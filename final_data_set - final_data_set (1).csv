Homotopy analysis method is combined with fractional generalised integral transform method to solve the fractional order nonlinear differential equations. The performance of the proposed method is analysed by solving various categories of nonlinear fractional differential equations like Navier Stokes’s model and Riccatti equations, etc. Unlike the other analytical methods, the hybrid method provides a better way to control the convergence region of the obtained series solution through an auxiliary parameter h. Furthermore, as proposed in this paper, the ‘Fractional Generalised Homotopy Analysis Method’ along with the several examples reveal that this method can be effectively used as a tool for solving various kinds of nonlinear fractional differential equations.', 'In this paper, we introduce the concept of soft g* closed sets and soft g* open sets in soft topological space which are defined over an initial universe set with a fixed set of parameters together with its corresponding soft g* closure and soft g* interior operators.

Fractal geometry is a methodology through which size reduction is achieved. A Self-similar fractal antenna using multicantor technique is proposed and experimentally studied. Space-filling cantors and self-similarity properties of fractal geometry have been adopted in the proposed antenna to miniaturize the size of antenna. The antenna is designed in such a way to operate at MICS band (Medical Implant communication Service) for wireless telemedicine application. The prototype antenna exhibits wideband characteristics and provides a good agreement of return loss (S11). Experimental return loss has been compared with that which is obtained using method of moments. The objective of using self-similar concept in antenna makes it flexible in terms of controlling the resonance and bandwidth. In this paper, the Self-similar property of fractal geometry is examined by maintaining return loss (S11) more than –30 dB approximately in all the iterations (n) and the prototype antenna has return loss greater than –10 dB and exhibits wideband characteristics.', 'This paper proposes the notion of a fractional generalised integral transform (Fractional G-transform) using modified Riemann-Liouville derivative with the Mittag-Leffler function as a kernel.

These attempts have met with mixed success. The focus of this review is the use of molecular markers as predictive tools in the context of practical hybrid plant breeding, not the use of molecular markers to understand the basis of heterosis.The term “heterosis” was coined by Shull in 1914, and refers to the manifestation of superiority of F1 performance relative to parental performance. The increase in vigor due to crossing,“heterosis,” and the decrease in vigor due to inbreeding,“inbreeding depression,” are linked in that each phenomenon defines the other. Heterosis has been utilized on a large scale for the production of crops such as maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, oilseeds, cotton, vegetables, and fruits, significantly boosting the production of these …', '', 'A set of 390 iso-cytoplasmic restorer lines were developed from 25 popular rice hybrids grown in India through pedigree breeding exercising selection for spikelet fertility, yield and extent of panicle exsertion were evaluated for various agromorphological traits. Correlation analysis showed that yield per plant was significantly correlated with number of tillers (0.208), panicle length (0.127) and spikelet fertility (0.134). Principal component analysis indicated that the first four principal components had eigenvalue of> 1.0 and cumulatively explained 74.3% of total variance. Grain characters namely, test weight (0.451), kernel length before cooking (0.418), kernel breadth before cooking (0.136) and spikelet fertility (0.402) contributed positively towards principal component I. Yield per plant showed a positively skewed distribution with panicle length and a nearly linear relationship with spikelet fertility. A core set of 21 genotypes capturing the entire range of phenotype for different traits, was identified from 390 genotypes using advanced M (maximization) strategy and statistically validated. Besides this, promising iso-cytoplasmic restorer lines originating from different hybrids were identified for various agromorphological traits. This is the first report on developing iso-cytoplasmic restorers from popular rice hybrids, which can be used in developing heterotic hybrids when crossed with diverse non-parental CMS lines.', 'The objective of this paper is to introduce the notion of fractional derivatives in the energy equations and to study the chaotic nature of the temperature distribution in a heat exchanger with variation of temperature dependent transport properties.

Isotonic separation is a supervised machine learning technique in which classification is represented as a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) with an objective of minimizing the number of misclassifications. It is computationally expensive to solve the LPP using traditional methods for a large dataset. Characteristics of the training set such as size, presence of noisy data, influence the learning algorithm and classification performance. To resolve this issue, this paper introduces a new linearithmic time algorithm called Soft set based instance selection algorithm (SOFIA) which provides a condensed dataset for a learning algorithm. And, a hybrid classification algorithm, SOFIAIS which utilizes SOFIA for instance selection and isotonic separation (IS) for classification is introduced. Two sets of experimental studies are conducted on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the results are reported. First, experiments are performed on SOFIA-IS and the results are compared with isotonic separation and its variants. Then experiments are done on state of the art machine learning techniques by including SOFIA for instance selection and the results are compared with same techniques without SOFIA. Experimental and statistical results show that the condensed sets obtained by SOFIA are optimum, and SOFIA-IS and SOFIA based machine learning techniques are better in terms of classification accuracy, time and space complexity.', 'Four hybrids, viz, PH-1, 2, 4 and 8 and their parental lines were studied for developing identification keys using morphological characters. Out of 39 characters studied, fourteen qualitative and six quantitative characters were polymorphic for identifying the parents from the hybrids and also among themselves. Characters like stem anthocyanin pigmentation on upper one-third portion, fruit green shoulder, leaflet petiole attitude with respect to main axis, leaf serration, stem pubescence, fruit shape at blossom end, fruit shape in longitudinal section and stigma lobes were important for development of identification keys. These characters were stable during two growing seasons (rabi 2014-15 and rabi 2015-16) and no variation was observed for any character in any genotype. A combination of these morphological markers could effectively utilized for distinguishing all the hybrids and their parental lines under study.', ""Kovalevsky [8] introduced the tracing algorithm in abstract cellular complexes.

The stochastic behavior of such processes makes them even more demanding to scrutinize over structured networks. This paper concerns the dynamics of a new susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model incorporated with multistage infection (infection delay) and an infective medium (propagation vector) over complex networks. In particular, we investigate the critical epidemic thresholds and the infection spreading pattern using mean-field approximation (MFA) and results obtained through extensive numerical simulations. We further generalize the model for any arbitrary number of infective media to mimic existing scenarios in biological and social networks.

In this paper, the stationary characteristics of an M/G/1 retrial queue is investigated where the single server, subject to active failures, primarily attends incoming calls and directs outgoing calls only when idle. The incoming calls arriving at the server follow a Poisson arrival process, while outgoing calls are made in an exponentially distributed time. On finding the server unavailable (either busy or temporarily broken down), incoming calls intrinsically join the virtual orbit from which they re-attempt for service at exponentially distributed time intervals. The system stability condition along with probability generating functions for the joint queue length distribution of the number of calls in the orbit and the state of the server are derived and evaluated numerically in the …', 'This letter characterizes the intertwined behavior of a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model involving multiple mutually exclusive memes, each competing over distinct contact planes of an undirected multi-layer social network, with the possibility of inter-switching. Based on the mean-field theory, we contrast and derive closed-form analytical expressions for the steady-state thresholds that govern the transitions between extinction, co-existence, and absolute dominance of the inter-switchable memes. Moreover, a non-linear optimization formulation is presented to determine the optimal budget allocation for controlling the switching rates to a particular co-existing meme. Validated by simulations, the impact of switching on the tipping thresholds and their implications in reality are demonstrated using data extracted from online social networks.', 'The spreading dynamics and control of infectious agents primarily depend on the connectivity properties of underlying networks. Here, we investigate the stability of a susceptible- infected-susceptible epidemic model incorporated with multiple infection stages and propagation vectors to mimic malware behavior over scale-free communication networks. In particular, we derive the basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ) and provide results for stability analysis at infection-free and infection-chronic equilibrium points. Based on R 0 , the effectiveness of four prevailing immunization strategies as countermeasures is studied and compared. The outperformance of proportional and targeted immunization is justified via numerical results.', 'This paper analyses the steady state behaviour of an M/G/1 retrial queue with impatient subscribers, two phases of essential service, general retrial time and general vacation time.

The steady state queue size distribution of number of customers in retrial group, expected number of customers in retrial group and expected waiting time of the customers in the orbit are obtained.

If the server is busy, arriving customer collides with the customer in service resulting in both being shifted to the orbit. After the collision the server becomes idle. If the orbit is empty the server takes at most M vacations until at least one customer is recorded in the orbit when the server returns from a vacation.

An arriving Type 1 call has a preemptive priority over a Type 2 call in service, if any, and the preempted Type 2 call enters into a retrial buffer (of finite capacity). Any arriving call not able to get into service immediately will enter into the pool of repeated calls provided the buffer is not full; otherwise, the call is considered lost. The calls in the retrial pool are treated alike (like Type 1) and compete for service after a random amount of time, and can preempt a Type 2 call in service. We assume that the two types of calls arrive according to a Markovian arrival process (MAP) and the services are offered with preemptive priority rule. Under the assumption that the service times are exponentially distributed with possibly different rates, we analyze the model using matrix-analytic methods. Illustrative numerical examples to bring out the qualitative aspects of the model under study are presented.', 'Greenhouse gas emission in transport sector is a major problem with its harmful effects on environment and population. This paper proposes to devise green routing solution for Mobile Advertisement Vehicle (MAV). The objective of the problem is to minimize route cost and carbon emission under time dependent speed constraint. The problem is modelled with hierarchical optimization and is solved in stages. This paper also highlights the idling emission estimation and its impact on the total emission. The problem is solved using Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) and the minimum cost routes obtained are improved using local exchange operator to minimize emission. The model is tested on a case study of mobile advertisement vehicle which produces minimum emission routes.', 'We developed a baffle design method based on a combination of the results of optical design software and analytical relations formulated herein. The method finds the exact solution for baffle parameters of a modified Ritchey–Chretien telescope by iteratively solving the analytical relations using the actual ray coordinates of the telescope computed with the aid of optical design software. The baffle system so designed not only blocks the direct rays of stray light reaching the image plane but also provides minimum obscuration to imaging light. Based on the iterative method, we proposed a baffle design approach for a rectangular-image-format telescope.', 'This paper studies a batch arrival general bulk service retrial queueing model with constant retrial rate. The primary customers arrive in bulk according to Poisson process and they get service under general bulk service rule with minimum of one customer and maximum of ‘b’ customers. If the arriving batch of customers, of size ‘ζ ’, 1≤ζ ≤ b , finds the server free, then all of them get service immediately; while, if the size of the arriving batch is more than ‘b’, then, ‘b’ customers enter the service station and the remaining ζ - b customers join the orbit. However, if an arriving batch of customers finds the server busy, then the entire batch joins the orbit in order to seek service again. The customers in the orbit will try for service one by one with a constant retrial rate ‘v’ when the server is idle.

The primary arrivals find the server busy or doing secondary job (vacation) will join orbit (group of repeated calls). If the number of repeated calls in orbit is less than N, the server does the secondary job repeatedly until the retrial group size reaches N. At the secondary job completion epoch, if the orbit size is at least N, then server remains in the system to render service either for primary calls or for repeated calls. For the proposed model, we carry out steady state system size distribution of number of customers in retrial group. We discuss its application of the proposed model to the analysis of a communication protocol like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and etc.', 'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which emerge from an un-attended environment monitoring, are deployed for monitoring purposes in different environments. But, WSNs suffer from vulnerable malware to propagate via exploiting message exchange among the sensor nodes. To draw attention to this issue, this paper investigates an optimal control strategy to reduce the spread of malware in wireless sensor networks. A node-based epidemic model Susceptible-Infected-Traced-Patched-Susceptible is analyzed. The optimal control strategies are analytically investigated. The proposed optimal strategy achieves a low level of infections at a low cost. Finally, numerical illustrations are presented to show the spread of malware through infected nodes which can be effectively suppressed by adopting the suitable optimal control strategy.', 'Rumor is an unauthenticated statement that gives significant changes in the social life of the people, financial markets (stocks and trades), etc. By incorporating the dissemination of rumor through groups in social, mobile networks and by considering the people’s cognitive factor (hesitate and forget), a new model on the rumor spreading process is presented in this paper. The spreading dynamics of rumor in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is analyzed by using mean-field theory. The reproduction number is obtained by using the next-generation matrix. The global stability of the rumor-free equilibrium for the homogeneous and heterogeneous model is proved elaborately.

The effects of various performance measures are derived.', 'Retrial queueing systems play a major role in many communication systems. The delay analysis of such systems poses an interesting problem in communication engineering. This has motivated us to analyze the waiting time distribution of a multi-server retrial queueing system with phase type retrial time, impatience and Bernoulli abandonments. The impact of retrial time on waiting time and other system characteristics is analyzed by determining the waiting time distribution. Numerical examples are presented to reveal the impact of the parameters.', 'Segregating the latency phase from the actual disruptive phase of certain mobile malware grades offers more opportunities to effectively mitigate the viral spread in its early stages. Inspired by epidemiology, in this letter, a stochastic propagation model that accounts for infection latency of disruptive malware in both personal and spatial social links between constituent mobile network user pairs is proposed. To elucidate the true impact of unique user attributes on the virulence of the proposed spreading process, heterogeneity in transition rates is also considered in an approximated mean-field epidemic network model. Furthermore, derivations for the system equilibrium and stability analysis are provided. Simulation results showcase the viability of our model in contrasting between latent and disruptive infection stages with respect to a homogeneous population-level benchmark model.', 'Telugu is one of the oldest languages in India. This paper describes the development of Telugu Text-to-Speech System (TTS). In Telugu TTS the input is Telugu text in Unicode. The voices are sampled from real recorded speech. The objective of a text to speech system is to convert an arbitrary text into its corresponding spoken waveform. Speech synthesis is a process of building machinery that can generate human-like speech from any text input to imitate human speakers. Text processing and speech generation are two main components of a text to speech system. To build a natural sounding speech synthesis system, it is essential that text processing component produce an appropriate sequence of phonemic units. Generation of sequence of phonetic units for a given standard word is referred to as letter to phoneme rule or text to phoneme rule. The complexity of these rules and their derivation depends upon the nature of the language. The quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its closeness to the natural human voice and understandability. In this paper we described an approach to build a Telugu TTS system using concatenative synthesis method with syllable as a basic unit of concatenation.', 'We have proposed a method to determine the focal length of microlens array (MLA) based on the measurement of transverse displacement of image spot in the focal plane for a change of angle of incidence of plane wavefront. An existing interferometer test setup, meant for the surface figure measurement of MLA substrate, along with a charge-coupled device (CCD) is used for this purpose. The interferometer generates as well as measures the angle of incidence of plane wavefront at the MLA, and the transverse displacement of the image spot is determined from images recorded with the CCD. We have also discussed the theory of estimation of the focal length of MLA with spherical wavefront. Error analysis is carried out for both methods and is compared. The proposed plane wavefront method is experimentally demonstrated with an off-the-shelf MLA, and the measured focal length is within 1% of catalogue value.', 'This study elucidates the dynamic behaviour of the two competing mutually exclusive epidemic (meme) spreading model with the alert of memes over multiplex social networks.

Positive customers are generated according to the first order Markovian arrival process with geometrically distributed lengths of On periods and Off periods. Further, the geometrically distributed arrival of negative customer removes the positive customers is any, and has no effect when the system is empty. The server state is a two state Markov chain which alternate between Good and Bad states with geometrically distributed service times. Closed-form expressions for mean queue length, unfinished work and sojourn time distributions are obtained. Numerical illustrations are also presented.', 'Aggregating a massive amount of disease-related data from heterogeneous devices, a distributed learning framework called Federated Learning (FL) is employed. But, FL suffers in distributing the global model, due to the heterogeneity of local data distributions. To overcome this issue, personalized models can be learned by using Federated multitask learning (FMTL). Due to the heterogeneous data from distributed environment, we propose a personalized model learned by federated multitask learning (FMTL) to predict the updated infection rate of COVID-19 in the USA using a mobilitybased SEIR model. Furthermore, using a mobility-based SEIR model with an additional constraint we can analyze the availability of beds. We have used the real-time mobility data sets in various states of the USA during the years 2020 and 2021. We have chosen five states for the study and we observe that there exists a correlation among the number of COVID-19 infected cases even though the rate of spread in each case is different. We have considered each US state as a node in the federated learning environment and a linear regression model is built at each node. Our experimental results show that the root-mean-square percentage error for the actual and prediction of COVID-19 cases is low for Colorado state and high for Minnesota state. Using a mobility-based SEIR simulation model, we conclude that it will take at least 400 days to reach extinction when there is no proper vaccination or social distance.', 'The deformation of the optical surfaces of a large aperture high-resolution space-borne optical system induced by earth’s gravity on the ground, which is not present during in-orbit operations, necessitates the evaluation of its performance in terms of wavefront error at various stages of development of the earth observation system. A direct method of evaluation for an optical system at an integrated electro-optical module based on a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH WFS) is proposed. Design and analysis of the wavefront sensor that are tailored to meet the requirements of the high-resolution optical system are described. We show that the procedure followed for the development of the SH WFS not only addresses the parameters of the wavefront sensor that are critical to its performance, but also aides in the wavefront sensor alignment and calibration. The performance of the developed SH WFS is demonstrated …', 'This book contains cutting-edge research material presented by researchers, engineers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry at the International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Cyber Security and Computational Models (ICC3) organized by PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore, India during December 19–21, 2013.

The server provides preliminary first essential service (FES) to the primary arriving customers or customers from retrial group. On successful completion of FES, the customer may opt for second optional service (SOS) with probability α. The server is subject to active break downs. The customer under FES (or SOS) during the failure decides, with probability q, to join the orbit(impatientcustomer) and, with complementary probability p, to remain in the server for repair in order to conclude his remaining service (patientcustomer). Both service and repair times are assumed to have general distribution. It is considered that the repair time of server during the presence of patient customer and the repair time of the server while the customer (impatientcustomer) joining the orbit due to failure, are different …', 'Knowledge on the dynamics of standard epidemic models and their variants over complex networks has been well-established primarily in the stationary regime, with relatively little light shed on their transient behavior. In this paper, we analyze the transient characteristics of the classical susceptible-infected (SI) process with a recovery policy modeled as a state-dependent retrial queueing system in which arriving infected nodes, upon finding all the limited number of recovery units busy, join a virtual buffer and try persistently for service in order to regain susceptibility. In particular, we formulate the stochastic SI epidemic model with added retrial phenomenon as a finite continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and derive the Laplace transforms of the underlying transient state probability distributions and corresponding moments for a closed population of size N driven by homogeneous and heterogeneous contacts …', 'The rapid development of network technologies and computing machines has broadened the scope of research and development in computer science and allied areas.

The system state distribution, the orbit size and the system size distributions are obtained in terms of generating functions. The stochastic decomposition law holds for the proposed model. Performance measures of the system in steady state are obtained. Finally, some numerical illustrations are presented to justify the influence of parameters on several performance characteristics.']","['https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16843703.2008.11673393', 'https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJOR.2010.033540',

Several research papers are discussed in this survey paper that discusses topics like Agile Outsourcing (AO), Agile Dispersed Development (ADD) and Distributed Agile Development (DAD). Also Pair-programming environments are discussed to give the user idea about them. A variant of Extreme Programming is discussed as distributed pair programming or virtual teaming which can be defined as a group of people, who work together towards a common goal, but across time, distance, culture and organizational boundaries. Research works at various universities like the one at NC State University that is a first indication that distributed pair programming is a feasible and efficient method for dealing with team projects. It was discussed that pair programming reduces the risk of subtle errors that would make debugging excruciating; It give us a much broader code review and It provides an opportunity to communicate knowledge between coders.

This has led to a surge in the number of new malware threats and has created several major challenges for the Anti-virus industry. Malware has affected desktop computers and mobile devices alike. Microsoft Windows is the most widely used consumer operating system worldwide, mostly used in desktop computers. Hence a vulnerability identified in one system could compromise a large number of systems.

Since the mobile devices nowadays are used for a wide variety of application areas like personal communication, data storage and entertainment, security threats emerge, comparable to those which a conventional PC is exposed to. Mobile malware has been growing in scale and complexity as smartphone usage continues to rise. Android has surpassed other mobile platforms as the most popular whilst also witnessing a dramatic increase in malware targeting the platform. In this work, we have considered Android based malware for analysis and a scalable detection mechanism is designed using multifeature collaborative decision fusion (MCDF). The different features of a malicious file like the permission based features and the API call based features are considered in order to provide a better detection by training an ensemble of …', 'Security of computers and the networks that connect them is increasingly becoming of great significance. Machine learning techniques such as Decision trees have been applied to the field of intrusion detection. Machine learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that are used to detect attacks on computer system. In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach. A comparative study of the three approaches is done …', 'Detection of malware using data mining techniques has been explored extensively. Techniques used for detecting malware based on structural features rely on being able to identify anomalies in the structure of executable files. The structural attributes of an executable that can be extracted include byte ngrams, Portable Executable (PE) features, API call sequences and Strings. After a thorough analysis we have extracted various features from executable files and applied it on an ensemble of classifiers to efficiently detect malware. Ensemble methods combine several individual pattern classifiers in order to achieve better classification. The challenge is to choose the minimal number of classifiers that achieve the best performance. An ensemble that contains too many members might incur large storage requirements and even reduce the classification performance. Hence the goal of ensemble pruning is to identify a …', 'In the recent past one of the harmful forms of malware seen is the Ransomware. The year 2016 has seen a huge rise in ransomware attacks. According to the study by Tripwire, Ransomware has done the most amount of damage to organizations in 2017, followed by DDoS, Malicious Insiders, Phishing, and Known/Unknown Vulnerabilities. In this work, Application Programming Interface (API) calls are extracted from the executables and the most discriminating API calls are used to train a classifier to detect unknown ransomware. We have tested our method on various classifiers like Decision trees, KNN, Random forest. Class imbalance due to the difference in the number of samples available in two classes - Ransomware and benign is also considered. It is seen that Random forest with smote for class imbalance has given a detection rate of over 98%. A large number of ransomware samples have been analyzed …', '', 'In recent years, social botnets have become a major security threat to both online social networking websites and their users. Social bots communicate over probabilistically unobservable communication channels and steal sensitive information from its victims. Stegobot is a social botnet which uses image steganography to hide the presence of communication. Since these botnets exhibit unique propagation methods, existing botnet detection techniques cannot identify these bots. In this paper, we propose an effective method to detect Stegobot hosts within a monitored social network. Based on the observations, Stegobot often has a differentiable communication pattern because of the unique design and implementation. Hence by investigating each host profile activity, it is possible to determine whether the profile is a Stegobot or normal. Our experiments show that the traffic patterns among Stegobot and normal …', 'The cyberspace continues to evolve more complex than ever anticipated, and same is the case with security dynamics there. As our dependence on cyberspace is increasing day-by-day, regular and systematic monitoring of cyberspace security has become very essential. A darknet is one such monitoring framework for deducing malicious activities and the attack patterns in the cyberspace. Darknet traffic is the spurious traffic observed in the empty address space, i.e., a set of globally valid Internet Protocol (IP) addresses which are not assigned to any hosts or devices. In an ideal secure network system, no traffic is expected to arrive on such a darknet IP space. However, in reality, noticeable amount of traffic is observed in this space primarily due to the Internet wide malicious activities, attacks and sometimes due to the network level misconfigurations. Analyzing such traffic and finding distinct attack patterns present …', ""Smart mobile device usage has expanded at a very high rate all over the world. Mobile devices have experienced a rapid shift from pure telecommunication devices to small ubiquitous computing platforms. They run sophisticated operating systems that need to confront the same risks as desktop computers, with Android as the most targeted platform for malware. The processing power is one of the factors that differentiate PC's and mobile phones. Mobile phones are more compact and therefore limited in memory and depend on a limited battery power for their energy needs. Hence developing apps to run on these devices should take into consideration the above mentioned factors. To improve the speed of detection, a multilevel detection mechanism using diverse data sources is designed for detecting malware balancing between the accuracy of detection and usage of less compute intensive computations. In this …"", 'In recent years, a number of works proposing the combination of multiple classifiers to produce a single classification have been reported. The resulting classifier, referred to as an ensemble classifier, is generally found to be more accurate than any of the individual classifiers making up the ensemble. In an ensemble of classifiers, it is hoped that each individual classifier will focus on different aspects of the data and error under different circumstances. By combining a set of so-called base classifiers, the deficiencies of each classifier may be compensated by the efficiency of the others. Ensemble pruning deals with the reduction of an ensemble of predictive models in order to improve its efficiency and performance. Ensemble pruning can be considered as an optimization problem. In our work we propose the use of Harmony search, a music inspired algorithm to prune and select the best combination of …', '', 'The most recent advancements in the dynamically expanding realm of Internet and networking technologies have provided a scope for research and development in computer science and its allied thrust areas.

We propose a new attribute splitting criteria for decision tree construction using the concept of Theil index. The Theil index is a statistic used to measure economic inequality. Results show a decrease in average height compared to the frequently used trees like ID3 and C4.5 using impurity measure as the splitting criterion. Detection of malware using data mining techniques has been explored extensively. Techniques used for detecting malware based on structural features rely on being able to identify anomalies in the structure of executable files. These features might indicate that the file was created or infected to perform malicious activity. They are applied to a decision tree using Theil index as splitting criterion for classification as malware or benign files.', 'While the increase of infertility all over the world is difficult to assess given the inconsistencies in defining infertility, about 15% of couples have difficulty in conceiving a baby at some point in their lives.

Current mitigation techniques are reactive, leading to the loss of files before ransomware is identified. We propose R-Sentry, a lightweight and real-time solution using honey files as deception, for the early detection of crypto ransomware. Honey files are disseminated throughout the filesystem, which if accessed, will alert the detection system leading to proactive termination of the ransomware process before encryption begins. Determining the optimal placement of honey files within a file system is challenging. R Sentry determines the optimal placement of honey files across various folders by analyzing the file traversal patterns of existing and future ransomware variants. Empirically we show that ransomware samples that follow several identified traversal patterns are …', 'The usage of Android smartphones is rapidly increasing.

The need for many variants on ins-del systems was raised by the computational completeness result of ins-del system with (optimal) size (1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1). Several regulations like graph-control, matrix and semi-conditional have been imposed on ins-del systems. Typically, computational completeness are obtained as trade-off results, reducing the size, say, to (1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0) at the expense of increasing other measures of descriptional complexity.

The worst case time complexity of binary search is O (log 2 n) where n is the number of elements (search space) in the array. However, in binary search, searching is performed on the entire search space. The complexity of binary search may be further reduced if the search space is reduced.

To secure the private networks of businesses and institutions, a firewall is installed in a specially designated computer separate from the rest of the network so that no incoming packet can directly get into the private network. The system monitors and blocks the requests from illegal networks. The existing methods of packet filtering algorithms suffer from drawbacks in terms of search space and storage.

The traditional authentication system of using text‐based passwords has many flaws in the aspects of usability and security issues. Hence, graphical passwords, which consist of clicking or dragging activities on the pictures rather than typing textual characters, were introduced to overcome this problem. However, it is found that these graphical passwords are susceptible to brute force and dictionary attack methods. To overcome this drawback, images can be used as password replacing alphanumeric and graphical passwords. The challenge lies in encrypting the image password and storing it in the database. An image edge password encryption (IEPE) algorithm is proposed to encrypt the image passwords based on its edge values. Experimental results are shown to prove that encrypted image passwords …', 'Encryption of data traffic in a network is essential since it is vulnerable to eavesdropping.

Search techniques are applied in file retrievals and indexing.

The worst case time complexity of binary search is O (log 2 n) where n is the number of elements (search space) in the array. However, in binary search, searching is performed on the entire search space. The complexity of binary search may be further reduced if the search space is reduced.

In the first step, the image is identified whether it is a left breast image or right breast image, then the film artifacts such as labels and x-ray marks are removed from the mammogram. Second, the high frequency components are removed using median filtering.

First, the mammogram image is segmented using MRF-ACSGA method to extract the suspicious region. Second, the conventional textural analysis methods such as Spatial Gray Level Dependency Method (SGLDM), Surrounding Region Dependence Method (SRDM), Gray-Level Run-Length Method (GLRLM) and Gray Level Difference Method (GLDM) are used to extract the features from the segmented image. A three-layer Backpropagation Neural Network classifier, trained by jack knife method and round robin method, is used to classify the extracted features into benign or malignant. The classification performances for the texture-analysis methods are evaluated using a Receiver Operating-Characteristics (ROC) analysis. The proposed algorithm and the techniques are tested on 161 pairs of digitized mammograms from MIAS database.', '', 'Detection of outliers and relevant features are the most important process before classification. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised k-means clustering is proposed for outlier detection in mammogram classification. Initially the shape features are extracted from the digital mammograms, and k-means clustering is applied to cluster the features, the number of clusters is equal with the number of classes. The clusters are compared with original classes, the wrongly clustered instances are identified as outliers and they are removed from the feature space. A novel Genetic Association Rule Miner (GARM) is applied with this reduced feature set to construct the association rules for classification. The performance is analyzed with rough set using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Computer aided diagnosis helps the radiologist to diagnose and treat the breast cancer at early stage. Recent studies states that Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) classifier achieves notable performance than the other classifiers. The major forte of ANFIS is that it has the robust learning mechanism with fuzzy data. However, the connections between the layers are not pruned for their significance. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based learning is proposed in this paper to improve ANFIS classifier with a novel pruning strategy. The proposed algorithm is inspired from the social life of a special species called ‘Weaver Ants’. The proposed classifier is evaluated with the mammogram images from MIAS database, the quantified results show that this weaver ant based learning strategy improves the ANFIS classifier’s performance.', 'Breast cancer is a most common disease diagnosed in women. The Microcalcification Clusters (MCs) in the mammograms are one of the important early sign. The accurate detection of microcalcifications is a key problem in Computer Aided Detection (CAD). In this paper, we have proposed a novel association rule mining approach for classification of microcalcifications. Initially, the shape features are extracted from the digital mammograms. With these feature values association rules are constructed to develop a rule based system for classification of microcalcifications. A novel Multidimensional Genetic Association Rule Miner (MGARM) is proposed for rule construction. The result shows that the proposed rule-based approach reaches the classification accuracy over 85% and also demonstrates the use and effectiveness of association rule mining in image classification.', 'A simple edge-based preprocessing scheme is proposed in this paper for contrast enhancement of digital mammogram images while preserving the edges more accurately. This proposed method has three steps: (i) initially the breast region is segmented from the mammogram images by removing the film artifacts, (ii) the pectoral muscle region is identified and excluded from the breast region using a novel adaptive thresholding method, and (iii) an Improved Watershed Segmentation (IWS) is applied to segment the breast profile, and each region is enhanced with simple histogram equalization. The segmentation is performed in order to achieve adaptive contrast enhancement. The performance of this proposed pectoral removal method is analyzed with two measures: Hausdorff Distance (HD) and Mean of Absolute Error Distance (MAED), and the proposed contrast enhancement approach is been analyzed with the …', 'Women suffering from breast cancer have been taken as a severe concern all around the world, as it directly distresses the next generation to come. The Microcalcification Cluster in the mammograms is one of the vital sign for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. In this paper, an improved Ant Colony Algorithm is proposed for the segmentation of MCs in two-steps:(a) watershed segmentation is applied on the edge map of the digital mammograms, which reduces the over-segmentation property of watershed algorithm enormously, and (b) a Guided Ant Colony Algorithm (GACA) is applied to merge the segmented regions together based on their homogeneity to produce the final segmentation into two different clusters such as normal and abnormal tissues. The performance of the classification is evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis. The greatest accuracy of 96% is achieved by GACA states …', 'The pectoral muscle represents a predominant density region in Medio-Lateral Oblique (MLO) views of mammograms, which appears at approximately the same density as the dense tissues of interest in the image and can affect the results of image analysis methods. Therefore, segmentation of pectoral muscle is important in order to limit the search for the breast abnormalities only to the breast region. In this paper, a simple and effective approach is proposed to exclude the pectoral muscle based on binary operation. The performance is analyzed by the Hausdorff Distance Measure (HDM) and also the Mean of Absolute Error Distance Measure (MAEDM) based on differences between the results received from the radiologists and by the proposed method. The digital mammogram images are taken from MIAS dataset which contains 322 images in total, out of which the proposed algorithm able to detect and remove …', 'Contrast enhancement of medical images could improve the quality of its visual contents for better diagnosis. In this paper, a novel walking ant histogram equalisation (WAHE) is proposed to improve the contrast of digital mammograms. The proposed method is hybridisation between the histogram equalisation with a novel ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm. Histogram equalisation is the concept of transferring input intensities to desired output intensities while improving the visual content of the images. Here we have used ACO for constructing the transfer functions. A fitness function is employed to control the transfer function construction in a balanced way. The experiments are carried out with the digital mammograms received from MIAS database, and results indicate the latent performance of the proposed contrast enhancement approach over the existing with finest results on all the contrast enhancement …', ""Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been applied in wide range of applications. In ACO, for every iteration the entire problem space is considered for the solution construction using the probability of the pheromone deposits. After convergence, the global solution is made with the path which has highest pheromone deposit. In this paper, a novel solution construction technique has been proposed to reduce the time complexity and to improve the performance of the ACO. The idea is derived from the behavior of a special ant species called ‘Leafcutter Ants', they spend much of their time for cutting leaves to make fertilizer to gardens in which they grow the fungi that they eat. This behavior is incorporated with the general ACO algorithm to propose a novel feature selection method called ‘Leafcutter Ant Colony Optimization'(LACO) algorithm. The LACO has been applied to select the relevant features for digital …"", 'Neural Networks (NNs) have been efficaciously used for classification purposes in medical domains, including the classification of microcalcifications in digital mammograms. Unfortunately, for a NN to be effective in a particular purview, its architecture, training algorithm and the domain variables selected as inputs must be amply chosen. In this paper, a novel Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based learning approach with a modified architecture is proposed to speed up the learning phase of a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPN) classifier. The novel ACO simulates the behavior of weaver ants, known for their unique nest building behavior where workers construct nests by weaving together leaves using larval silk.

During clustering the items with shortest assigning paths from centroids are grouped together. The summation of grouped items should not exceed the capacity of cluster.

In reality, the demand of consumers is not known a priori. This kind of distribution is dealt by Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem (SVRP) which is a NP-hard problem. In this proposed work, VRP with stochastic demand is considered. A probability distribution is considered as a random variable for stochastic demand of a customer. Approach: In this study, VRPSD is resolved using Meta heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Hybrid PSO (HPSO). Dynamic Programming (DP) is used to find the expected cost of each route generated by GA, PSO and HPSO. Results: The objective is to minimize the total expected cost of a priori route. The fitness value of a priori route is calculated using DP. In proposed HPSO, the initial particles are generated based Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (NNH). Elitism is used in HPSO for updating the particles. The algorithm is implemented using MATLAB7. 0 and tested with problems having different number of customers. The results obtained are competitive in terms of execution time and memory usage. Conclusion: The computational time is reduced as polynomial time as O (nKQ) time and the memory required is O (nQ). The ANOVA test is performed to compare the proposed HPSO with other heuristic algorithms.', 'The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a NP-hard and Combinatorial optimization problem.

There are several researches have been performed to provide personalized learning paths for individual learners. But many of them collect the learners’ interest, habits and behavior from their profile and based on that they recommend learning path. It is the fact that the learners’ interest, learning attitude and need will vary from time to time and course to course. In this paper a recommendation system is proposed using semantic net that helps the learners by offering a more intelligent approach to navigating and searching course content. In this the learner will get more personalized and contextual recommendation. The results show that semantic net based methods enable interoperability of heterogeneous course content representation and result in accurate recommendations.

The key challenge in the teaching learning process of e-learning is assessing the students’ learning. Learning means the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, practice, or study, or by being taught. Assessing the students learning on the topics being taught is very important in e-learning environment. Based on the student’s learning, the system can change / update the pedagogy, recommendations can be made for further study, and the students’ performance can be evaluated. Many e-learning systems assess student learning by conducting tests, quizzes or assignments. In this paper, we propose concept map based on assessment from students’ learning using ontology mapping.

Learners are often getting confusion by the flow of information and have difficulty in selecting the topic to learn that satisfies their needs and interests. There are several researches have been performed to provide personalized learning paths for individual learners. But many of them collect the learners’ interest, habits and behavior from their profile and based on that they recommend learning path. It is the fact that the learners’ interest, learning attitude and need will vary from time to time and course to course. In this paper a recommendation system is proposed using semantic net that helps the learners by offering a more intelligent approach to navigating and searching course content. In this the learner will get more personalized and contextual recommendation. The results show that semantic net based methods enable interoperability of heterogeneous course content representation and result in accurate recommendations. The validity of the proposed model is shown using sample learners and performance measures for the recommendation effects are given for evaluating the proposed system.', '', 'A common task in many applications is to find persons who are knowledgeable about a given topic.

A total of 541 mutants, including the macromutants and the trait-specific ones, obtained after appropriate screening, are being maintained in the mutant garden. Here, we report on the detailed characterizations of the 541 mutants based on the distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) descriptors at two different locations. About 90% of the mutants were found to be similar to the wild type (WT) with high similarity index (>0.6) at both the locations.

The mutants have been created in the background of Nagina 22, a popular drought- and heat-tolerant upland cultivar. As it is a pregreen revolution cultivar, as many as 573 dwarf mutants identified from this resource could be useful as an alternate source of dwarfing. A total of 541 mutants, including the macromutants and the trait-specific ones, obtained after appropriate screening, are being maintained in the mutant garden. Here, we report on the detailed characterizations of the 541 mutants based on the distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) descriptors at two different locations. About 90% of the mutants were found to be similar to the wild type (WT) with high similarity index (>0.6) at both the locations. All 541 mutants were characterized for chlorophyll and epicuticular wax contents, while a subset of 84 mutants were characterized for their ionomes, namely, phosphorous, silicon, and chloride contents. Genotyping of these mutants with 54 genomewide simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed 93% of the mutants to be either completely identical to WT or nearly identical with just one polymorphic locus. Whole genome resequencing (WGS) of four mutants, which have minimal differences in the SSR fingerprint pattern and DUS characters from the WT, revealed a staggeringly high number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on an average (16,453 per mutant) in the genic sequences.

The proposed models assign global agreement score to users. A linear function of any baseline user similarity and global agreement score of users is defined as a new similarity measure. From inception, recommendation approaches are keen on improving accuracy of recommended items and downplays the diversity of …', 'Recommender systems serve as business tools which make use of knowledge discovery techniques to reshape the world of E-Commerce. Collaborative filtering (CF), the most effective type of recommender systems, predicts user preferences by learning from past user-item relationships. Prediction algorithms are based on similarity between item vectors or user profiles. However similarity computations become less efficient if item vectors or user profiles do not contain enough ratings. A technique which is based on Pseudo Relevance Feedback is proposed to expand item vectors in order to make them contain more ratings. The proposed approach first expands item profiles and refines the expansion in order to remove expansion deviations. The experiments on MovieLens data set show that the proposed technique is efficient in expanding the rating matrix and outperforms state of the art collaborative …']","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437119311963', 'https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218194018500420', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-26404-2_4', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40925-7_31', 'https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/big.2020.0038', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-26832-3_48', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437121009948', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-3274-5_7']","[['item based collaborative recommender systems', 'items', 'user exposure diversity', 'monotonic preferences', 'predictions', 'Rating predictions', 'essential business tools', 'user point', 'accuracy', 'the user exposure diversity and item concordance'], ['software components', 'new usage scenarios', 'software systems', 'components', 'system classes', 'software developers', 'software reuse', 'code search engines', 'recent times', 'Code reuse'], ['user preferences', 'noisy users', 'Users', 'user', 'users', 'items', 'Movielens', 'predictions', 'real world data', 'lesser popularity score'], ['probability based user relevance scores', 'user relevance score', 'similar rating pattern', 'predictions', 'user preferences', 'users', 'benchmark item', 'CF approach', 'diversified ratings', 'relevance scores'], ['user privacy', 'high privacy', 'utility', 'effective recommendation', 'sensitive customer information', 'privacy', 'little attention', 'recommendation', 'personal information', 'high accuracy'], ['user similarity scores', 'similar users', 'user', 'users', 'pair wise similarity', 'popular items', 'Collaborative Filtering', 'various items', 'Recommender systems', 'Information overload problem'], ['similar users', 'user', 'users', 'Bayesian Global Agreement model', 'global agreement score', 'common rated items', 'recommendation approaches', 'appropriate recommendations', 'User Trait Model', 'recommended items'], ['enough ratings', 'more ratings', 'item profiles', 'user profiles', 'item vectors', 'expansion deviations', 'E-Commerce', 'user preferences', 'knowledge discovery techniques', 'state']]"

To predict the class label of the unlabelled samples, the attribute values in the mined patterns are compared with the corresponding attribute values of the unlabelled sample. The count of number of attribute values in the mined patterns matching with that of the unlabelled sample gives the attribute match count.

The algorithm works in two phases. In the first phase, the CCN is represented as a binary image and the binary image is encoded as digits. The second phase involves the design of a stream cipher method to encrypt the encoded image using a fireworks key generation credit card number encryption (FWKGCNE) algorithm for key generation. One outstanding advantage of CCE algorithm is the reduction in the number of keys to be stored and distributed. Experimental results demonstrating encryption of CCNs using CCE algorithm and the comparison with the existing methods are presented.

The goal of classification is to accurately predict the target class for an unlabelled sample by learning from instances described by a set of attributes and a class label. Conventional classification methods specified in literature are less efficient in classifying very small datasets with repeated attribute values. To overcome this drawback, the study explores a classification method by mining similar patterns among the instances in very small datasets. Classification by Mining Patterns (CMP) algorithm is proposed to predict the class label of the unlabelled sample by mining similar patterns among the instances in the dataset. To mine similar patterns, the instances in the dataset belonging to the same class label are grouped. The instances in each group that differ by one attribute value are merged. Such merged instances form mined patterns. To predict the class label of the unlabelled samples, the attribute values in the mined patterns are compared with the corresponding attribute values of the unlabelled sample. The count of number of attribute values in the mined patterns matching with that of the unlabelled sample gives the attribute match count. The mined patterns having the maximum attribute match count are grouped and the majority class label of the mined patterns is predicted as the class label of the unlabelled sample. To choose the attributes in the mined patterns for comparison, an Ant Colony Optimization based Feature Selection Mined Patterns (ACOFSMP) is proposed. Simulation results are shown to prove that the CMP algorithm is efficient …', 'Personal identification is crucial to secure data against cyber-attacks. With increasing identity theft, fingerprint recognition systems have a growing importance in enforcing security and reliable identification. Although, most fingerprint recognitions systems use minutiae features for fingerprint matching, they require extensive pre-processing of fingerprints when the image quality is poor. This may introduce false ridge patterns, degrading the performance of the system. Moreover, fingerprint matching over a large database can be inefficient due to high computation time of fingerprint matching algorithms. This demand for fingerprint recognition systems that are fast and reliable. This paper proposes a computationally intelligent fingerprint recognition system that extracts ridge patterns from the fingerprint for matching. Hierarchical Heterogeneous Ant Colony Optimization based Fingerprint Matching (HHACOFM) algorithm …', 'Search is considered to be an important functionality in a computational system. Search techniques are applied in file retrievals and indexing. Though there exists various search techniques, binary search is widely used in many applications due to its advantage over other search techniques namely linear and hash search. Binary search is easy to implement and is used to search for an element in a large search space. The worst case time complexity of binary search is O (log 2 n) where n is the number of elements (search space) in the array. However, in binary search, searching is performed on the entire search space. The complexity of binary search may be further reduced if the search space is reduced. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization based Binary Search (ACOBS) algorithm to find an optimal search space for binary search. ACOBS algorithm categorizes the search space and the key …', 'Learning a classifier from imbalanced data is one of the most challenging research problems. Data imbalance occurs when the number of instances belonging to one class is much less than the number of instances belonging to the other class. A standard classifier is biased towards the majority class and therefore misclassifies the minority class instances. Minority class instances may be regarded as rare events or unusual patterns that could potentially have a negative impact on the society. Therefore, detection of such events is considered significant. This chapter proposes a FireWorks-based Hybrid ReSampling (FWHRS) algorithm to resample imbalance data. It is used with Weighted Pattern Matching based classifier (PMC+) for classification. FWHRS-PMC+ was evaluated on 44 imbalanced binary datasets. Experiments reveal FWHRS-PMC+ is effective in classification of imbalanced data. Empirical results were …', 'Encryption of credit card numbers (CCNs) is essential since it is vulnerable to eavesdropping when stored in the database or during transfer in the network. Security of data is the necessity of the hour since communications over open network occur frequently. A novel algorithm termed credit card number encryption (CCE) is proposed to encrypt the CCN. The algorithm works in two phases. In the first phase, the CCN is represented as a binary image and the binary image is encoded as digits. The second phase involves the design of a stream cipher method to encrypt the encoded image using a fireworks key generation credit card number encryption (FWKGCNE) algorithm for key generation. One outstanding advantage of CCE algorithm is the reduction in the number of keys to be stored and distributed. Experimental results demonstrating encryption of CCNs using CCE algorithm and the comparison with the existing methods are presented. Simulation and analysis results show that CCE algorithm is greatly sensitive to the keys and the algorithm has a large space of keys. Security analysis of CCE algorithm was performed to demonstrate that the algorithm is resistant to image attacks.', 'Machine learning is the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn based on empirical data. The goal of Machine learning is to build computer systems that adapt and learn from their experience. Machine learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. An example of supervised learning is classification. Classification is defined as the task of learning from examples which are described by a set of predictive attributes and a class attribute. The result of learning is a classification model that is capable of accurately predicting the class label of unknown instances based only on the values of the predictive attributes. Classification has been successfully implemented using instance based methods.In recent days, reclassification of objects is considered vital in certain applications including financial sector and e-commerce. Reclassification may be achieved with the help of action rules. Images can also be classified using Point Pattern Matching (PPM). PPMis a task to pair up the points in twoimages of a same scene.Some of the practical applications of PPM include model-based tracking and recognition of a referenced template pattern in images, duplicate image identification, remotely sensed data with applications in civilian, agriculture, geology, oil and mineral exploration, astronomy and militaryapplications.The traditional methods forclassification, action rule mining and image matching using point pattern matching are beset with drawbacks justifying a compelling need to look for better / efficient solutions.In this workthe possibilities of heuristic methods such …', 'Cluster Pattern Matching based Classification (CPMC) is a classification technique based on a similarity measure between the training instances and the unknown sample. An Ant Colony Optimization based feature selection is proposed to select the features. According to this approach, the training data set is clustered. The cluster to which the unknown sample belongs is found and each of the selected features of the unknown sample is compared with the corresponding feature of the training instances in the cluster and the class of the unknown sample is predicted based on majority voting of class labels having highest number of matching patterns. A probabilistic approach is used to predict the class label when more than one class label has the same majority.

Recent innovations eliminate the difficulties in traditional approach such as manual counting, locating the object, and data management. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) implementation in SCM improves the visibility of real-time object movement and provide solutions for anti-counterfeiting. RFID is a major prerequisite for the IoT, which connects physical objects to the Internet. Various research works have been carried out to perform object tracking using GPS, video cameras, and wifi technology. These methods just hope to see the actual object, but not the characteristic changes of the object due to environmental changes. After reviewing the implementation of latest technologies in object tracking system, it is expected that the security and privacy risks in large-scale IoT systems are to be eliminated and an efficient IoT …', 'In recent days, the most important concern in the Internet of Things (IoT) is to experience distinct technologies in the communication systems. Smart grid is a pertinent common application under a single umbrella of the IoT and it can accomplish the communication via the Internet Protocol to sustain the information exchange between the service provider and the smart meter in the system. However, IP-based communication systems make this task susceptible to several serious security attacks. To prevent these attacks, many security protocols between the service provider and smart meter have been proposed in the literature. Existing security mechanisms allow the smart meters to establish a connection with the service provider, but it is essential to design a security system by which the service provider can communicate with multiple smart meters and establish a connection with them. To establish such connection, all …', 'In supply chain management applications, detection of a large object is made efficient by attaching multiple RFID tags in that object. Each part contains an RFID tag attached by the corresponding vendor. In order to check the availability of the object, it is compulsory to ensure all the parts are existing as well. The RFID tags can be interrogated by any reader deployed in the department. This approach enhances the object detection probability for each object but increases security and privacy risks. The communication between RFID readers and the tags in the same department is to be authenticated by preserving the privacy of both reader and the tag. Several researchers have developed variants of grouping protocol for authentication and for searching the tags. In this article, Shen et al.’s scheme for authenticating multiple tags in a group is analyzed and found that secret parameters are leaked in that …', 'Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology enables unique identification and tracking of the tag attached to an object. Widespread usage of RFID technologies in supply chain management (SCM) has drawn attention for developing security protocols to protect data stored in the tag. In SCM objects move from one place/department to another, the same RFID readers are not used throughout the supply chain. So, current reader delegates its access right to the new reader. When an object is moved inside the organization, delegation takes place between the readers. Many of the existing delegation protocols use trusted third party (TTP), which is practically difficult to incorporate or requires a keyed hash function/symmetric key encryption to be executed in the RFID tag, whereas tags are computationally intensive. Our work aims to simplify the delegation process by removing the usage of a TTP as well as …', 'Most of the existing RFID based ownership transfer protocols are in need of TTP or require reader to reader communication in a centralized system. In the post supply chain, the products are to be tracked to prove their originality in a distributed environment. This paper aims to provide a verifiable ownership transfer of products attached with an RFID tag using blockchain technology to address various security requirements. The proposed protocol consists of two phases; in the first phase the buyer commits to buy the product and in the second phase actual ownership is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Analysis of the proposed protocol is carried out and it shows that our protocol is relatively better than the existing related schemes with respect to security requirements.', 'The smart vehicular technology in the smart city employs intelligent commitments to the passengers to enhance traffic efficiency and safety with more enjoyable riding in the driving environment. However, the tremendous growth of wireless communication technology makes the smart vehicle communication more vulnerable to potential security attacks. Authentication and key agreement protocol is the basic requirement to establish a secure communication among vehicles in the open network. Though several security schemes have been designed in the literature to establish communication among the smart vehicles, each of them have their own limitations such as requirement of heavy computation, limited to maximum of three entities and so on. In this paper, we design a lightweight four party authentication protocol that employs the strong reinforcement of fog and cloud servers. The formal proof of …', 'Nowadays payment protocols are facing difficulties in its implementation, as the parties involved in the execution deny their performed actions. In this context, there should be a provision to link the action to the concerned party, which is addressed by the accountability property. In this paper, a new framework in strand space model for the analysis of accountability property is proposed that can overcome the drawbacks of the existing models. Strand space model is improved so that the analysis of accountability property of a payment protocol that is designed under symmetric key cryptosystem can be done. As a test example, symmetric key based BPAC, a bill payment protocol ensuring accountability is used. Fine-grained analysis of accountability property of BPAC protocol is carried out and proved its correctness using the automated support provided by CPSA along with the strong mathematical proof.', 'Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a valuable technology for tracking objects in the supply chain. Security and privacy requirements arise with the fast deployment of RFID in supply chain in a heterogeneous environment. Authentication is one of the important security requirements in cloud environment. Even though several RFID cloud authentication protocols are available for supply chain management, they lack to satisfy some security requirements. There is a need for secure, efficient, and scalable protocol for agile supply chain. In this paper, an RFID cloud authentication protocol is proposed and an informal security analysis is carried out. Performance analysis is done with respect to the tag entity. The proposed protocol is scalable and it preserves tag/reader privacy, provides mutual authentication and resistant to many attacks. Comparison with the existing protocol in terms of communication cost shows …', 'Design patterns are used in software development to provide reusable solutions. Patterns can improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems. Shuffle is a method which refers to jumble together, mix, or interchange the positions of objects. The shuffling technique is applied to gaming applications like Jigsaw puzzle, Sudoku, jumbled word game, etc. In music software, shuffling refers to the ability to randomize the order of the songs in a playlist. Thus, shuffling has a vast number of known uses in the software industry. The purpose of this paper is to contrive a design technique from existing solutions for shuffling, to make them more accessible to the developers of new systems.

The combinations of …', 'Product review classification plays a vital role in understanding the likes and dislikes of users of the product. This analysis can be utilized to improve the quality of product as expected by users. In this paper, classification of reviews is performed using Naïve Bayes and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. The key factors contributing to improving classification performance are proper feature weights and less number of dimensions. To improve feature weights, a novel feature weight modification technique is proposed which is based on sentiment scores of the Synset words of input set of words. And to reduce the number of dimensions, we used Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique. From the results, it is proved that the proposed method of modifying weights gives significant improvement in classification performance', 'Web mining is broadly classified into three categories namely, Web Content Mining(WCM), Web Structure Mining(WSM)and Web Usage Mining(WUM). WCM analyses the content of web pagesusing different mining techniques. WSM finds the popularity score of a page by following link structure of the web. WUM analyses the data about the web users to predict future usage of the web. The thesis aims at improving the ordering and grouping of search results using WSM and WCM so that the user can select the relevant document in a faster manner. The first part of the thesis aims atimproving the existing WSMbased PageRank algorithm by includingweight for the links between the connected documents. For weight calculation, distance among the documents is calculated using Euclidean distance measure. Using the calculated distance values, weightvalues are computed.

The energy hole formation incurs heavy casualties on network lifetime which results in early failure of the entire network. This is because of the premature death of sensors in the sink’s immediate locality which can be postponed by exploiting sink mobility.

Caching performance can be improved by designing good replacement policies, prefetching techniques, clustering of web users and proper placement of proxy caches in the network.

Digital images are used in fields like telemedicine, military communication, and space research, so it is essential to protect the images from unauthorized disclosure during transmission. In this paper, a novel image encryption method is proposed using scan pattern, circular shift, and transposition methods. The pixels of the original image are permuted by the scan pattern generated by the notion of Kth smallest and stack dynamically. The circular shift and transposition are done by Shuffling Key (SK) generated from the original image. Value transformation is performed to confuse the relationship between the original and encrypted images using bitwise XOR operation. The proposed method satisfies the performance analysis tests such as histogram, correlation, large key space, and acceptable encryption speed. Also, the proposed method is resistant to statistical, brute force, and differential attacks.', 'Transmission and storage of multimedia data like audio, video, and images over the Internet has increased in today’s digital communication. Among the different multimedia data, images are transmitted and used very often. It is essential to protect the multimedia data from unauthorized disclosure during transmit. A novel approach for encrypting digital images using Matrix Reordering (MR), a kind of scanning, and simple XOR operation is proposed in this paper. The MR is applied to permute the pixel positions and the XOR operation is done to diffuse the pixel values. The bitwise XOR operation is performed using pseudorandom numbers generated by the linear congruential method. The image encryption algorithm evaluation parameters such as histogram, correlation, cut test, dispersion test, visual testing, and speed test have been conducted using the suggested method, and the results are analyzed. The analysis shows that the proposed system is resistant to statistical and differential attacks, and could be used in real-time applications to provide confidentiality service for images with less computational overhead.', 'Need for information security and privacy is increasing in recent times. Since several valuable data and files are stored in an organization server system and moreover personal information are being shared in WWW, the need for providing security and permitting only the authorized user is becoming indispensable. For this purpose, biometric authentication is used in several applications and it is progressively acquiring more attention in the field of research. Several biometrics like fingerprint, iris, retina, etc., are used in rendering security to the information or key. The generation of cryptographic key from biometrics is used generally to secure the system. On the other hand, the storage and security for the biometric templates and the encryption keys are of a major concern. The effectiveness and the flexibility of the cryptographic key generation schemes make it suitable for integrating it with the biometric features (Biometric cryptosystems). Security is one of the major concerns in the present world and there is need for many researches to deal with the better biometrics based cryptographic key generation schemes. In this survey, discussed the several biometrics based cryptographic key generation schemes which will show the way for development of better security schemes using biometrics and cryptography.', 'Effective prediction of software modules, those that are prone to defects, will enable software developers to achieve efficient allocation of resources and to concentrate on quality assurance activities. The process of software development life cycle basically includes design, analysis, implementation, testing, and release phases. Generally, software testing is a critical task in the software development process wherein it is to save time and budget by detecting defects at the earliest and deliver a product without defects to the customers. This testing phase should be carefully operated in an effective manner to release a defect-free (bug-free) software product to the customers. In order to improve the software testing process, fault prediction methods identify the software parts that are more noted to be defect-prone. This paper proposes a prediction approach based on conventional radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the novel adaptive dimensional biogeography based optimization (ADBBO) model. The developed ADBBO based RBFNN model is tested with five publicly available datasets from the NASA data program repository. The computed results prove the effectiveness of the proposed ADBBO-RBFNN classifier approach with respect to the considered metrics in comparison with that of the early predictors available in the literature for the same datasets.', 'Secured data storage and transmission has become an important issue in the digital world due to the increased use of Internet for communication purposes. Information security is becoming more important as the amount of sensitive data being exchanged on the Internet increases. The services like confidentiality and data integrity are required to protect data against unauthorized usage and modification. In recent years, several image encryption methods are introduced by various researchers to secure multimedia information while transit via public networks. A novel image encryption method based on pixels position permutation and random key stream is suggested in this paper. The pixels position permutation is done based on Hilbert Curve (HC). The pixel shuffled image is XORed with random key stream constructed by adopting the random bit pattern procedure used in the MD5 hash function to obtain the cipher …', 'Increasing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging issue in many sensor applications due to the limited energy available in sensor nodes. To improve the lifetime of a sensor network, it is essential to achieve load balancing among the sensor nodes. The grouping of sensor nodes into clusters is an efficient technique for conserving energy. Cluster Heads are elected for each of these clusters, in order to collect and aggregate the data from the sensor nodes within a cluster and forward it to the sink through a single-hop or multi-hop relay. In a multi-hop relay, cluster heads near to the sink are exposed to heavy traffic. The energy of these nodes is soon depleted and this is referred to the ‘hot-spot’ issue in sensor networks. This paper proposes a geo-clustering process based on the location of the sink. Each of the clusters is assigned a set of geo-cluster heads, in which a primary cluster head is …', 'In emerging wireless sensor applications, sensor nodes are equipped with low battery and limited capacity when transmitting the sensed data to the sink.To prolong the lifetime of sensor networks, the energy consumption has to be reduced and the bandwidth channel utilization has to be improved. To accomplish these requirements, we have proposed a new scheme as software based multi-flow in wireless sensor network. This scheme is developed based on the Software Defined Network (SDN) and allocates separated channels for data plane and control plane. It also generates inbuilt software module in every sensor nodeto increase the speed of the network. The proposed scheme is used to maintain the topology and also manages the limited battery power usage. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed software based multi flow in terms of indispensible network parameters including …', 'Exact and automatic recognition and authentication of users are a essential difficulty in all systems. Shared secrets like Personal Identification Numbers or Passwords and key devices such as Smart cards are not presently sufficient in few situations. What is required is a system that could authenticate that the person is actually the person. The biometrics is improving the capability to recognize the persons. The usage of biometrics system permits the recognition of a living person according to the physiological features or behavioral features to be recognized without human involvement. This leads to the world wide usage of biometrics to secure the system. The various biometrics used in securing system are fingerprint, iris, retina, etc. The construction of cryptographic key from biometrics is used generally to secure the system. The efficiency and the flexibility of the cryptographic make it suitable for securing purpose. In some times, biometrics can be stolen; this makes the attackers to access the system for any time. This problem is diminished in this paper by using two biometrics features. The biometrics used in this paper is fingerprint and iris. These two features are combined with the help of fusion algorithm. From the combined features, cryptographic key is generated. The experimental result shows that the proposed techniques results in better security than the existing techniques.', '', '', 'In the development of various large-scale sensor systems, a particularly challenging problem is how to dynamically organize the sensor nodes into a wireless communication network and route sensed information from the field sensors to a remote base station. This work presents a new energy-efficient dynamic clustering technique for large-scale sensor networks. By monitoring the received signal about power from its neighboring nodes, each node estimates the number of active nodes in real time and computes its optimal probability of becoming a cluster head, so that the amount of energy spent in both intra- and inter-cluster communications can be minimized. Cluster head selection is an important problem in sensor networks. Cluster-based routing has been shown to be more energy efficient and increase the network lifetime through data aggregation. The goal is to select cluster heads that minimize transmission …', 'Web prefetching is an effective technique to minimize user’s web access latency. Web page content provides useful information for making the predictions that is used to perform prefetching of web objects. In this paper we propose semantic prefetching scheme that uses anchor texts present in the web page to make effective predictions. The scheme applies Naïve Bayes Classifier for computing the probability values of anchor texts, based on which the predictions are generated and given as input to the prefetch unit. Predictions are dynamic and are based on the browsing pattern exhibited by the user in a session. The browsing pattern of user should be specific towards a particular topic of interest to achieve good hit rate. When user has long browsing sessions, predictions and prefetching are more effective and helps to increase the hit rate and minimize access latency.', 'This paper proposes novel energy efficient algorithm FDPCA for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). However, energy consumption is one of the major drawbacks in most of the Wireless Sensor Networks. Parameters like End to End Delay and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) are considered for exercising the influence on transmit power. These parameters are fuzzified and optimal transmission power levels are selected. The throughput for both DPCA and FDPCA are compared. High throughput is obtained by using FDPCA. In our first phase, the parameters are calculated. The proposed algorithm can effectively save energy without degrading the throughput of the network and reduce the energy consumption of the network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly overtake previous method, in terms of throughput. Keywords: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Dynamic Power Control Algorithm (DPCA), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), End to End Delay (EED), Throughput, Fuzzy Logic.', 'Node localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one of the most important primary requisite that needs to be resolved efficiently as it plays a significant role in many applications namely environmental monitoring, routing and target tracking which is location dependent. Localization is defined as finding the physical co-ordinates of a group of sensor nodes. Localization is classified as an unconstrained optimization problem. Localization protocols are broadly classified as range-based and range-free protocols. The range based protocols employ distance or angle estimation techniques, hardware. The range-free techniques depend on the contents of received messages to support coarse grained accuracy. In this paper, a range-free localization method known as Mobile Anchor Positioning-Mobile Anchor & Neighbor (MAP-M&N) is used to calculate the location of sensor nodes. Mobile Anchor equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS), broadcasts its coordinates to the sensor nodes as it moves through the network. As the sensor nodes collect enough beacons, they are able to calculate their locations. MAP-M&N with Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MAP-M&N with FSO) is the proposed metaheuristic approach to calculate the location of sensor nodes with minimal error. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the performance metric to compare between the two approaches namely, MAP-M&N and MAP-M&N with FSO. Simulation results reveal that MAP-M&N with FSO algorithm is effective to bring down the localization error to a bigger level when compared to using only MAP-M&N algorithm.', 'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are employed in various applications from healthcare to military. Due to their limited, tiny power sources, energy becomes the most precious resource for sensor nodes in such networks. To optimize the usage of energy resources, researchers have proposed several ideas from diversified angles. Clustering of nodes plays an important role in conserving energy of WSNs. Clustering approaches focus on resolving the conflicts arising in effective data transmission. In this chapter, we have outlined a few modern energy-efficient clustering approaches to improve the lifetime of WSNs. The proposed clustering methods are:(i) fuzzy-logic-based cluster head election,(ii) efficient sleep duty cycle for sensor nodes,(iii) hierarchical clustering, and (iv) estimated energy harvesting. Classical clustering approaches such as low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and selected contemporary clustering methods are considered for comparing the performance of proposed approaches. The proposed modern clustering approaches exhibit better lifetime compared to the selected benchmarked protocols.', 'Localization is considered as one of the most significant research issues in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The objective of localization is to determine the physical co-ordinates of sensor nodes distributed over the sensing field. Location information plays a vital role for coverage, deployment of sensor nodes, routing and target tracking applications. Initially, the localization of sensor nodes can be performed by Mobile Anchor Positioning (MAP), a range-free localization method. To further enhance the location accuracy obtained by MAP, we propose three algorithms, viz. Differential Evolution with MAP (DE-MAP), Ant Colony Optimization with MAP (ACO-MAP) and Simulated Annealing-Differential Evolution with MAP (SA-DE-MAP). The scope of this work is to compare the performance of these three algorithms. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been used as the metrics for comparing the performance. Simulation result demonstrates that out of the proposed algorithms, SA-DE-MAP algorithm achieves better performance in minimizing the localization error when compared to DE-MAP and ACO-MAP algorithms.', 'The important tasks in a wireless sensor network such as routing, target tracking are highly dependent on the location of a sensor node. Hence localization becomes an essential criterion in wireless sensor networks. Higher the localization accuracy better is the performance of the sensor network as a whole. Traditional mathematical algorithms can be used for localization. But these algorithms do not give very high localization accuracy. Genetic algorithm is proven to be effective in searching a solution space and hence can be modeled for the localization problem in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The strategy used in this paper for localization uses two phases. The first phase uses a traditional range free localization algorithm based on Mobile anchor to estimate the location of a sensor node roughly. The second phase is a post optimization phase that uses Genetic algorithm which increases the accuracy of localization.']","['https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10025257073/',

scheduling in cloud computing', 'link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5705847/', 'authors': 'S Selvarani, G Sudha Sadhasivam', 'publication_date': '2010/12/28', 'conference': '2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'description': 'Cloud computing has been build upon the development of distributed computing, grid computing and virtualization. Since cost of each task in cloud resources is different with one another, scheduling of user tasks in cloud is not the same as in traditional scheduling methods. The objective of this paper is to schedule task groups in cloud computing platform, where resources have different resource costs and computation performance. Due to job grouping, communication of coarse-grained jobs and resources optimizes computation/communication ratio. For this purpose, an algorithm based on both costs with user task grouping is proposed. The proposed scheduling approach in cloud employs an improved cost-based scheduling algorithm for making efficient mapping of tasks to available resources in cloud. This scheduling algorithm measures both resource cost and computation performance, it also improves the …', 'total_citations': {'cited_by': {'total': 266, 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1114963571559213243&as_sdt=5', 'serpapi_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=1114963571559213243&engine=google_scholar&hl=en', 'cites_id': '1114963571559213243'}, 'table': [{'year': 2012, 'citations': 8}, {'year': 2013, 'citations': 20}, {'year': 2014, 'citations': 22}, {'year': 2015, 'citations': 33}, {'year': 2016, 'citations': 36}, {'year': 2017, 'citations': 41}, {'year': 2018, 'citations': 23}, {'year': 2019, 'citations': 20}, {'year': 2020, 'citations': 23}, {'year': 2021, 'citations': 20}, {'year': 2022, 'citations': 16}, {'year': 2023, 'citations': 1}]}}, {'title': 'Design and implementation of an efficient two-level scheduler for cloud computing environment', 'link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5328452/', 'resources': [{'title': 'from researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vasanth-Ram-Rajarathinam-2/publication/224149006_Design_and_Implementation_of_an_Efficient_Two-Level_Scheduler_for_Cloud_Computing_Environment/links/53eed4510cf26b9b7dcddb6e/Design-and-Implementation-of-an-Efficient-Two-Level-Scheduler-for-Cloud-Computing-Environment.pdf'}], 'authors': 'R Jayarani, Sudha Sadhasivam, N Nagaveni', 'publication_date': '2009/10/27', 'conference': '2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'description': 'Cloud computing focuses on delivery of reliable, fault-tolerant and scalable infrastructure for hosting Internet based application services.

The main objective of this paper is to compare and study the drawbacks of the performance of different existing similarity measures against the proposed similarity measure that use the concept of collaborative filtering technique. Methods/Analysis: Collaborative filtering has turned into one of the most used technique to give personalized services for users. The key of this technique is to find alike users or items using user-item rating matrix such that the system can show recommendations for users. Experiments on Web Service (WSDL) data sets are conducted and compared with many traditional similarity measures namely Pearson correlation coefficient, JacUOD, Bhattacharyya coefficient. The result shows the superiority of the proposed similarity model in recommendation performance. Findings: However, existing approaches related to these techniques are derived from similarity algorithms, such as Pearson correlation coefficient, mean squared distance, and cosine. These methods are not much efficient, particularly in the cold user conditions. Applications/Improvement: This paper presents a new user based similarity calculation model to enhance the recommendation performance and to estimate the similarities for each user. The proposed model incorporates two traditional similarity measures namely Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Jaccard Coefficient.', 'Resource management in a grid environment is complex. Scheduling strategy plays an important role in the grid environment to schedule the user jobs, and dispatch them to appropriate grid resources. A good task scheduling method is essential to reduce the total time taken for job execution in the grid. In a grid environment, the jobs are processed at the grid resources in a fine-grained form that results in a low computation-communication ratio. So an efficient job grouping-based scheduling system is required to dynamically assemble the individual fine-grained jobs of an application into a group of jobs and then transmit these coarse-grained jobs to the grid resources. The objective of this paper is to develop a scheduling strategy using job groups that optimizes the utilization of processing capabilities of grid resource and reduces the total time taken to process user jobs.', 'Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used techniques for personalized recommendation services to users, since it can assist users to specify their interest on available items. The key feature of this technique is to find similar users by applying similarity measures on user-item rating matrix. Personalized system can thus provide recommendations for users based on the interest of the active user as well as a likeminded users. The success of the recommendation process depends upon the similarity metric used to find the most similar users. Similarity measures like cosine, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Jaccard Uniform Operator Distance etc are not much effective when user-item rating matrix is sparse. This paper presents a new similarity model to calculate the similarities between each user, when only few ratings are available in the user profile. The proposed model considers both global preference as well as the local context of the user behavior. Experiments are conducted on two different datasets and compared with many existing similarity measures. The results of the experiments show that the proposed similarity measure improves the performance of the personalized recommendation process.', 'Big data has become Buzzword in recent years. It is due to the fact that voluminous amount of structured, semi structured and unstructured data that is generated in the digital era. But, this huge data can be tracked and used for monetary benefits which thwart individual’s privacy. Hence numerous fruitful researches are made in privacy preservation. This book chapter lays emphases on the state-of-art privacy preserving data mining mechanisms and reviews the application of these mechanisms in big data environment.', 'Authentication remains as significant security challenge in hadoop environment. Hadoop does not strongly authenticate the client. As a result, data nodes can be accessed using block locations. This paper suggests the usage of the fundamental properties of a triangle and dual servers to improve the security level of hadoop clusters The password given by the user is interpreted and alienated into more than one unit using the authentication server and stored in multiple Backend Servers along with the corresponding username. The Authentication Server uses the values stored in multiple Backend Servers to authenticate the user. Authentication and Backend servers work together to authenticate the user. The registration process and the authentication process are hosted as a web service to authenticate the users before logging into the hadoop cluster. This paper suggests three approaches for security enhancement …', 'Online news article reading has become very popular as the World Wide Web provides an access to variety of news articles from large volume of sources around the world. A key challenge of news portals is to provide articles to the users based on their interest. Personalized news recommendation systems provide news articles to the readers based on their interest rather than presenting articles in order of their occurrences. The effectiveness of news recommendation systems reduces due to lack of user ratings and automated novelty detection. A progressive summary helps a user to monitor changes in news items over a period of time. The automatic detection of novelty in personalized news recommendation system could improve a reader’s search experience by providing news items that add more information’s to already known information’s to the users. This paper presents a rough set based …', '', 'Traditional news recommendation systems strive to adapt their services to individual users by virtue of both user and news context information. This paper describes personalized news recommendation approach based on dynamic updating policy and collaborative filtering. Adaptive user profiling is a principled framework for news selection based on the intrinsic property of user interest presented, with a good balance between the novelty and diversity of the recommendation result. Also it considers the exclusive characteristics like news context, access patterns, popularity of the news and recency. Collaborative filtering approach can efficiently capture user’s behavior in case where the overlap in historical assumptions across users in relatively high and the context universe is almost static. The major issue with the personalized news recommendation system is scalability. This paper addresses the above mentioned issue with the help of hadoop framework. Experiments on a collection of sports related news obtained from various news websites demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.', 'Financial reports of corporations publicise their performance. This in turn motivates manipulation of financial statements. Falsification of financial statements over prolonged period results in sudden collapse of multi-national companies, long-term economic loss to government and loss of trust of public. Detecting management frauds using normal audit procedures is time expensive as huge volume of data needs to be analysed. Hence additional analytical procedures should be used. The proposed work aims at automated analysis of annual reports using MapReduce paradigm to identify fraudulent companies. Annual reports of companies from public repositories are parsed to extract features for preparing a score card. Principal component analysis is applied on the score card to extract the principal features to train support vector machine. Experimental results show that 90% accuracy can be achieved using 10% to …', 'Data mining is the process of extracting hidden patterns from data. With the explosion of data at a tremendous rate, data mining is essential to extract useful information. Association rule mining is a method of finding correlation relationships among large set of data items. A rule is characterized as sensitive if its disclosure risk is above a certain confidence value. Sensitive rules should not be disclosed to the public, as they can be used to infer sensitive data and provide an advantage for the business competitors. Techniques for hiding association rules are limited to binary items. But, real world data consists of quantitative values. In this paper, a method to hide fuzzy association rule is proposed, in which, the fuzzified data is mined using modified apriori algorithm in order to extract rules and identify sensitive rules. The sensitive rules are hidden by decreasing the support value of Right Hand Side (RHS) of the rule. A …', 'An association rule is classified as sensitive if its thread of revelation is above certain confidence value. If these sensitive rules were revealed to the public, it is possible to deduce sensitive knowledge from the published data and offers benefit for the business competitors. Earlier studies in privacy preserving association rule mining focus on binary data and has more side effects. But in practical applications the transactions contain the purchased quantities of the items. Hence preserving privacy of quantitative data is essential. The main goal of the proposed system is to hide a group of interesting patterns which contains sensitive knowledge such that modifications have minimum side effects like lost rules, ghost rules, and number of modifications. The proposed system applies Particle Swarm Optimization to a few clusters of particles thus reducing the number of modification. Experimental results demonstrate that the …', 'In recent years, cloud computing has evolved as an effective, proactive and widely accepted technology. Scalability is an important characteristic to the success of enterprises involved in doing business with cloud. Auto scaling has the ability to scale up or down the cloud resources based on demand. As Auto-scaling provides better fault tolerance, better availability and cost management, it improves an organization’s service level agreements. Most of the cloud service providers implement simplistic reactive autoscaling where resource availability is modified as a reaction to predefined threshold value set. However calculating the exact number of resources to scale up is a challenging task and hence to be addressed efficiently. The other issues arising with respect to auto scaling in cloud is handling dynamic number of requests from time to time with efficient usage of existing resources, adapting a combination of …', 'In large-scale distributed systems, where adversarial attacks have extensive impact, authentication provides fortification against threats involving impersonation of entities and tampering of data. Towards this, we introduce the first tetrahedron (three-dimensional (3D)) based two-server Password Authenticated and Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol to represent text passwords. A 3D PAKE protocol is a hybrid cryptographic algorithm that requires two servers for authentication; one server engages with users and the other is hidden from the clients. A remarkable aspect of the proposed 3D PAKE protocol is that reclaiming password from the stored credentials is not possible when either one/both the servers gets compromised. In this paper, we discuss the properties of tetrahedron that mesh well with Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol and elliptic curve cryptography encryption scheme and proved that the protocol is …', 'The main aim of this paper is to design a scheme to identify the species from its genome sequence. Feature descriptors for a genome sequence are identified using MapReduce framework. Each feature descriptor is a three lettered keyword generated using A, T, C, G nucleotide bases. Genome sequences of related species are clustered by considering the feature descriptor count. MapReduce version of clustering model that uses K-means, Differential Evolution (DE) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been proposed. This MapReduce model improves accuracy as the entire genome sequence is considered. The inherent parallelism in the MapReduce model also enhances execution time efficiency.', 'Mobile communication plays an important role in disaster recovery management during emergency situations. It is helpful in situations where the system has less robust and less flexible fixed infrastructure. The Disaster recovery management systems require timely interaction and coordination in order to save lives and property. Energy consumption in heterogeneous network is a major issue, whether they operate within a base station infrastructure, fixed network or in a free-standing Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). The lifetime of network will be improved by suitably reducing the requirement of power for connections. There is a challenge to provide Quality of Service (QoS) solutions to wired cum wireless domains and maintain end-to-end QoS in ad hoc network. In this paper we propose a new protocol Power Aware QoS Multipath Routing protocol (PAQMR) for disaster recovery network. This protocol is the enhanced protocol of Ad-Hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector protocol (AOMDV). This routing protocol is used to avoid the loop formation in network so that it reduces congestion in the channel. The Network Simulator (NS-2.34) tool is utilized to measure the performance of AODV, AOMDV and PAQMR protocols in hybrid environment. The metrics for the simulation are energy consumption, average end to end delay and packet delivery ratio by varying the traffic load and pause time in the network. The results shows that the proposed protocol minimize the power, delay, congestion and maximize the packet delivery ratio.', 'Mobility management and bandwidth management are two major research issues in a cellular mobile network. Mobility management consists of two basic components: location management and handoff management. To Provide QoS to the users Handoff is a key element in wireless cellular networks. It is often initiated either by crossing a cell boundary or by deterioration in the quality of signal in the current channel. In this paper, a new admission control policy for cellular mobile network is being proposed. Two important QoS parameter in cellular networks are Call Dropping Probability (CDP) and Handoff Dropping Probability (HDP). CDP represents the probability that a call is dropped due to a handoff failure. HDP represents the probability of a handoff failure due to insufficient available resources in the target cell. Most of the algorithms try to limit the HDP to some target maximum but not CDP. In this paper, we show that when HDP is controlled, the CDP is also controlled to a minimum extent while maintaining lower blocking rates for new calls in the system.', 'In this paper, we have implemented Multipath routing algorithms for heterogeneous network. Multipath routing separates the traffic among different paths to minimize congestion in terms of multiple alternative paths through a network which can provide a variety of benefits such as minimize delay and congestion, maximize bandwidth, or improved security. We propose a newly improved QoS multipath routing algorithm for heterogeneous networks. Different types of adhoc routing protocols are discussed in this paper such as Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Ad-Hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV), QoS Ad-Hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector (QAOMDV), AOMDV is the extension of AODV routing protocol. QAOMDV is QoS version of AOMDV. These routing protocol are used in wireless network which is designed to form multiple routes from source to the destination and also avoid …', 'Smartphones usage have become ubiquitous in modern life serving as a double-edged sword with opportunities and challenges in it. Along with the benefits, smartphones also have high exposure to malware. Malware has progressively penetrated thereby causing more turbulence. Malware authors have become increasingly sophisticated and are able to evade detection by anti-malware engines. This has led to a constant arms race between malware authors and malware defenders. This survey converges on Android malware and covers a walkthrough of the various obfuscation attacks deployed during malware analysis phase along with the myriad of adversarial attacks operated at malware detection phase. The review also unscrambles the difficulties currently faced in deploying an on-device, lightweight malware detector. It sheds spotlight for researchers to perceive the current state of the art techniques available to fend off malware along with suggestions on possible future directions', 'The goal of grid computing is to provide powerful computing for complex scientific problems by utilizing and sharing large scale resources available in the grid. Efficient scheduling algorithms are needed to allocate suitable resources for each submitted task. So scheduling is one of the most important issues for achieving high performance computing in grid. This paper addresses an approach for optimizing scheduling using a nature inspired Intelligent Water Drops (IWD) algorithm. In the proposed approach IWD algorithm is adopted to improve the performance of task scheduling in grid environment. The performance of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for task scheduling is compared with the proposed IWD approach and it is proved that task scheduling using IWD can efficiently and effectively allocate tasks to suitable resources in the grid.', 'Power consumption of nodes in ad hoc networks and fixed network is major issue in current world. The lifetime of network will be improved by suitably reducing the requirement of power for connections. There is a challenge to provide QoS solutions that operate seamlessly over wired-wireless domains and maintain end-to-end QoS with user mobility. In this paper we have proposed different QoS Multipath routing protocols for heterogeneous network. Multipath routing separates the traffic among different paths to minimize congestion in terms of multiple alternative paths through a network which can provide a variety of benefits such as minimize delay and congestion , maximize bandwidth or improved security.

mammographic image processing. It can be classified into two categories: direct contrast enhancement and in direct contrast enhancement. Indirect contrast enhancement involves in modifying histogram of the image. Histogram equalization (HE) is the simplest indirect contrast enhancement technique which is widely used for contrast enhancement. Many variants of HE are proposed so far. Comparison of these techniques is significantly essential in deciding a suitable algorithm for enhancement and further processing.

The proposed work comprises two modules: the Activity Recognition (AR) module and the Abnormal Activity Detection (AAD) module. The data from a wearable sensor unit is processed using the AR module to detect ADLs of an MCI patient. The AR module uses ensemble machine learning techniques to detect an MCI patient’s activities. Stochastic gradient boosting detects the ADL with …', ""The choice of using the channel efficiently in mobile Ad hoc Networks is improved by creating multiple channel accessibility for attaining improved system functionality that depends on the metrics such as point to point delay, throughput and overhead. Most probably delivery of QoS (quality of service) hugely complicated in multiple channel ad hoc networks and the available adaptation and signaling methods for QoS, exist in literature survey primarily helps static-width channels or dynamic-width channels that limit the performance of a network. This Erlang Factor Integrated Channel Allocation Mechanism (EFICAM) model analyzes to improve ad hoc network's system functionality. EFICAM utilizes a combined scheme of availability and performance of the existing channel conditions through Erlang Factor that computes the rejection rate of the network. The decision on user request rejection rate depends upon the …"", 'Prolonged network lifetime, scalability and reliability are the most common requirements for many ad-hoc sensor network applications. Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique to achieve these goals. This paper assumes a heterogeneous network structure where nodes with higher capabilities act as cluster heads and others as members of the cluster. Nodes use multi hopping to reach the cluster heads and hence the cluster heads and the nodes closest to them decide the lifetime of the network. The contributions of this paper are: (i) it outlines the design issues to be considered in optimizing the performance of large-scale wireless sensor networks operating under energy and reliability constraints, (ii) It provides a model to calculate the optimum number of clusters to guarantee a minimum lifetime and validates the model using a simulation study', 'Mammographic images are of low contrast and low resolution. Improving contrast and resolution of the image along with edge preservation in screening mammograms will aid to detect the breast cancer in early stage. In this paper we proposed a hybrid image enhancement technique for mammographic image enhancement. The Recursive mean separate histogram equalization technique (RMSHE) is applied for brightness preserving contrast enhancement. Then DWT-SWT filtering is applied for resolution and edge preservation. The performance of the hybrid enhancement technique is compared with traditional methods using effective measure of contrast enhancement (EME).', 'In recent years, optimization and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively used in numerous milieus and hostile topographies. In this paper, we proposed an improved localization algorithm by means of Least square and Minimum mean square error that evolvements with the basic DV-Hop algorithm. The localization error is shortened by our proposed algorithm and improves the localization accuracy of the basic DV-Hop algorithm with minimum number of beacon nodes. The proposed method is simulated and compared with other algorithms such as DV-Hop, ROCRSSI and APIT. The simulation is considered both with obstacle as well as without obstacle.', 'Among the numerous numbers of applications the viability of wireless sensor networks have been thought about, environmental monitoring constitutes an important field of application. Given the severity of potential climate changes and its effect on the environment, it is a domain where the use of sensor networks can have great impact and as such, is getting more and more attention. The world we live in is currently undergoing dramatic changes at a global scale, ie, global warming. Most of the time, environmental scientists cannot precisely answer questions regarding the cause and effects, mainly because of the lack of adequate data, given the multifaceted nature of the problem. Specifically, the challenge lies in developing viable techniques to collect and analyze large volumes of spatial and temporal observations of environmental parameters. An easy-to-deploy-and-configure pervasive WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) can be of great help to meet this objective. This paper discusses a framework for wireless sensor networks designed to capture and monitor surface soil moisture level-one of the key contributors of climate change modeling. The data collected could be used for building various models that could enhance our understanding about the effects of climate change on agricultural farms. In a crop field, this data can also be used to prepare effective irrigation schedules; dry situations can be alarmed and adequate irrigation can be done just on time. The paper proposes a communication efficient framework for collecting spatio-temporal observations of surface soil moisture. The proposed work prepares a moisture distribution map that is …', 'In-networks, Data Aggregation is usually warranted for distributed wireless sensor networks, owing to reliability and energy efficiency reasons. Sensor nodes are usually deployed in unattended and unsafe environments and hence are vulnerable to intentional or unintentional damages. Individual nodes are prone to different type of faults such as hardware faults, crash faults etc and other security vulnerabilities wherein one or more nodes are compromised to produce bogus data so as to confuse the rest of the network in collaborative sensing applications. The availability of constrained resources and the presence of faulty nodes make designing fault tolerant information aggregation mechanisms in large sensor networks particularly challenging. In our work, we consider Byzantine type of faults, which encompasses most of the common sensor node faults [9]. Faulty nodes are assumed to send inconsistent and arbitrary values to other nodes during information exchange process. These values are termed as outliers and we use a statistical test called Modified Z-score method to reliably detect and remove outliers. We show by simulation that the proposed strategy works well for 2 major classes of collaborative sensor network applications viz.(i) Target/Event detection and (ii) Continuous data gathering.', 'Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm paves the way of connecting every object with the Internet environment to share information that improves the quality of life. On the other hand, the cloud computing facilitates pay per use model by providing on demand delivery of computing resources. The IoT can gain unlimited resources and computing capabilities from the cloud and the cloud can step ahead in its way towards the real life scenarios in a dynamic and distributed manner. This chapter introduces the role of cloud computing in IoT and discusses the need to integrate IoT and cloud, highlighting its benefits and implementation challenges. It also emphasizes the role of evolution of cloud based IoT systems towards federated ecosystems and its architecture, requirements and challenges', 'This chapter illustrates the role of IoT platform in Enterprise application development.

but powerful data structure that can check membership to a static set. The trade-off to use Bloom filter is a certain configurable risk of false positives. The odds of a false positive can be made very low if the hash bitmap is sufficiently large. Spam is an irrelevant or inappropriate message sent on the internet to a large number of newsgroups or users. A spam word is a list of well-known words that often appear in spam mails.

DAN model relies on both simple vector operations and neural network-based models for learning the compositionality. The depth of the model allows it to capture subtle variations in the input even though the composition is unordered. However, overfitting is a serious problem in any deep neural network. Dropout is a technique for addressing overfitting in large neural networks. The idea is to randomly drop neurons and their connections from the neural network during training phase. This prevents neurons from co-adapting. DAN includes a variant of dropout where individual words are dropped rather than individual neurons of the feed forward network. But since this technique has the potential to drop critical words it may have significant impact on the performance of the model in text classification tasks. This paper deliberates on this drawback and the impact of dropping individual neurons rather than word-level dropout.'}, {'title': 'Comparative Study on Different Word Embedding Techniques', 'link': 'https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.7-12-2021.2314494', 'resources': [{'title': 'from eudl.eu', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.7-12-2021.2314494'}], 'authors': 'S Lovelyn Rose', 'publication_date': '2021', 'description': 'Recent advancements in distributional semantics allow a word to be represented in a multi-dimensional semantic space as vectors.

The other hand based modalities such as vein, and finger knuckle are gaining importance. This paper proposes a methodology for secure biometrics authentication using Finger Knuckle Print (FKP). The texture patterns from finger knuckle are extracted using Gabor with Exception-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the feature vectors from these texture patterns are acquired using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. The main focus is to reduce the false rejection rate without increasing the false acceptance rate and to improve the performance over the conventional hand based modalities. The performance is compared with Genuine Acceptance Rate …', 'Problem statement: The problem is to classify a given web query to a set of 67 target categories. The target categories are ranked based on the degree of similarity to a given query. Approach: The feature set is the set of intermediate categories retrieved from a directory search engine for a given query. Using direct mapping and Normalized Web Distance (NWD) the intermediate categories are mapped to the required target categories. The categories are then ranked based on three parameters of the intermediate categories namely, position, frequency and a combination of frequency and position. Results: The results proved that the third parameter gave a better result and a maximum of 40 search result pages ensure better results. Conclusion: With NWD as the similarity measure, the precision and recall is found to increase by 10% over the previous methods.', 'Assistive technology would be an immense benefit for hearing impaired people by using Audio Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Around 466 million people worldwide suffer from hearing loss. Hearing impaired student rely on lip reading for understanding the speech. Lack of trained sign language facilitators and high cost of assistive devices are some of the major challenges faced by hearing impaired students. In this work, we have identified a visual speech recognition technique using cutting edge deep learning models. Moreover, the existing VSR techniques are erroneous. Hence to address the gaps identified, we propose a novel technique by fusion the results from audio and visual speech. This study proposes a new deep learning based audio visual speech recognition model for efficient lip reading.

This paper uses various preprocessing techniques, forms a feature vector using lexicons and classifies tweets into Paul Ekman's basic emotions namely, happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust and surprise using machine learning. Preprocessing is done using the dictionaries available for emoticons, interjections and slangs and by handling punctuation marks and hashtags. The feature vector is created by combining words from the NRC Emotion lexicon, WordNet-Affect and online thesaurus. Feature vectors are assigned weight based on the presence of punctuations and negations in the feature and the tweets are classified using naive Bayes, SVM and random forests.

Around 70% of people in India speak Indo-Aryan languages whereas 19% speak Dravidian languages which are agglutinative morphologically rich. Speech is a lucid, time-saving, and effortless means of communication. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a process that accurately transcribes spoken utterances into text. Speech recognition in Indian languages will empower people to easily access their regional language to any content they desire. The ultimate goal of this proposed work is to develop a novel deep sequence modeling-based ASR system with improved spell corrector for seven low-resource languages. The efficacy of our proposed model is evaluated using word error rate (WER) and sequence match ratio. The end-to-end ASR system based on a recurrent neural network-gated recurrent unit (RNN-GRU …', 'Deep neural networks are powerful machine learning systems and many deep learning models for natural language processing tasks focus on learning the compositionality of their inputs. DAN model relies on both simple vector operations and neural network-based models for learning the compositionality. The depth of the model allows it to capture subtle variations in the input even though the composition is unordered. However, overfitting is a serious problem in any deep neural network. Dropout is a technique for addressing overfitting in large neural networks. The idea is to randomly drop neurons and their connections from the neural network during training phase. This prevents neurons from co-adapting. DAN includes a variant of dropout where individual words are dropped rather than individual neurons of the feed forward network. But since this technique has the potential to drop critical words it may have significant impact on the performance of the model in text classification tasks. This paper deliberates on this drawback and the impact of dropping individual neurons rather than word-level dropout.', 'Recent advancements in distributional semantics allow a word to be represented in a multi-dimensional semantic space as vectors. Words that are semantically and syntactically similar are closer in value. Popular methods to generate such embeddings include neural networks, reduction of word-to-word co-occurrence matrices, contextual representation and so on. Most embedding techniques are based upon the distributional hypothesis which states that words in the same context are semantically similar and hence can be broadly classified into count based methods and predictive methods. Word embeddings are quite popular in the field of Natural Language Processing in addition to other fields such as text mining, Sentiment analysis, Information Retrieval, Polarity Detection and so on. This paper aims to make a comprehensive study on the different word embedding techniques available.', '', '', '', '', 'Optimal automatic classification of web queries aid in improving the performance of search engines.

Coverage holes are the fundamental issue which affects the quality of the WSNs. Only if the coverage holes are detected, they are patched using sensor nodes known as healing. It is not possible to find the coverage holes manually. Therefore the coverage hole, detecting and healing have become a major challenges in order to achieve the best coverage of the WSNs. For this purpose, we proposed the algorithm named as a Delaunay Triangulation merged with the virtual edge based method; it helps to detect the coverage holes in WSNs. The algorithm helps to detect the accurate size of the coverage holes when compared to the existing tree based method. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method detects the coverage hole more accurately and finally …', 'total_citations': {'cited_by': {'total': 12, 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=4226071067590665644&as_sdt=5', 'serpapi_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=4226071067590665644&engine=google_scholar&hl=en', 'cites_id': '4226071067590665644'}, 'table': [{'year': 2018, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2019, 'citations': 3}, {'year': 2020, 'citations': 4}, {'year': 2021, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2022, 'citations': 3}]}}, {'title': 'Active Queue Management Algorithm for TCP Networks Congestion control', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Santhi-Venkatraman/publication/324684082_Active_Queue_Management_Algorithm_for_TCP_Networks_Congestion_Control/links/5adc1e5daca272fdaf85a5e6/Active-Queue-Management-Algorithm-for-TCP-Networks-Congestion-Control.pdf', 'resources': [{'title': 'from researchgate.net', 'file_format': 'PDF', 'link': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Santhi-Venkatraman/publication/324684082_Active_Queue_Management_Algorithm_for_TCP_Networks_Congestion_Control/links/5adc1e5daca272fdaf85a5e6/Active-Queue-Management-Algorithm-for-TCP-Networks-Congestion-Control.pdf'}], 'authors': 'V Santhi, A.M.

It requires grid scheduling to achieve high performance. The efficient scheduling of independent jobs in a heterogeneous computing environment is an important problem in domains such as grid computing. In general, finding optimal schedule for such an environment using the traditional sequential method is an NP-hard problem whereas heuristic approaches will provide near optimal solutions for complex problems. The Ant colony algorithm, which is one of the heuristic algorithms, suits well for the grid scheduling environment using stigmeric communication.

It is a powerful tool to uncover relationships within the data. Association rule mining is an important data mining model to mine frequent items in huge repository of data. It frames out association rules with the help of minimum support and confidence value which in turns paves way to identify the occurrence of frequent item sets. Frequent pattern mining starts from analysis of customers buying habits. From which various associations between the different items that the customers purchase are identified. With the help of such associations retailers perform selective marketing to promote their business. Biologically inspired algorithms have their process observed in nature as their origin. The best feature of Ant colony algorithm, which is a bio inspired algorithm based on the behaviour of natural ant colonies, is its parallel search over the problem data and previously obtained results from it. Dynamic memory management is done by pheromone updating operation. During each cycle, solutions are constructed by evaluation of the transition probability through pheromone level modification. An improved pheromone updating rule is used to find out all the frequent items. The proposed approach was tested using MATLAB along with WEKA toolkit. The experimental results prove that the stigmeric communication of improved ant colony algorithm helps in mining the frequent items faster and effectively than the existing algorithms.', 'This chapter discusses the implementation of a human-computer interaction system for deaf and mute people in developing countries.

Emotions have an important role in teaching as well as other disciplines. It is understood that, while culture, the environment, the language and behavior of people vary, emotions are considered to be universal among the entire human population. Emotions are also important in the realm of education, because their power rivals that of the environment or the language used to communicate information. It's important for cognitive functions including learning and digesting new information. Student emotions during lectures play an important role whether it's in classrooms or in virtual learning environments. Unfortunately, due to the adoption of a virtual method of study or simply the incapacity of humans to keep track of all students in a classroom, teachers do not always keep students' emotions in check, making it difficult to adjust and keep the line of communication open. Thus automated facial emotion detection is very useful and brings the hidden indicators of students internal emotions to limelight. The suggested method aids in the detection of emotions and their classification in order to detect interest in a topic, which is then used as feedback to the course management staff in order to improve learner experience and aid in course material updates."", 'Hostel management is a Web application that is created for managing various hostel activities that limit physical labor and makes jobs much easier for all the users of the app. Many universities are using the traditional procedure for storing data.

Providing security to sensitive data against unauthorized access has been a long term goal for the database security research community. Almost all the research in privacy preservation is limited to binary dataset. Business and scientific data contain both quantitative and categorical attributes. The technique used for privacy preservation must ensure security of the database while maintaining the utility and certainty of the mined rules at highest level. This paper presents two techniques to hide quantitative sensitive fuzzy association rules-Weighted Item Grouping Algorithm and Rank based Correlated Rule Hiding Algorithm. Then the performance of the two techniques is evaluated based on the number of lost rules and ghost rules generated and how effectively the sensitive rules are hidden. The experimental results shows that the Rank based correlated rule hiding provides better performance than weighted item grouping in terms of side effects and number of modifications.', 'total_citations': {'cited_by': {'total': 4, 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=7593875954973456815&as_sdt=5', 'serpapi_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=7593875954973456815&engine=google_scholar&hl=en', 'cites_id': '7593875954973456815'}, 'table': [{'year': 2016, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2017, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2018, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2019, 'citations': 1}]}}, {'title': 'Privacy Preservation with Attribute Reduction in Quantitative Association Rules using PSO and DSR', 'authors': 'G Sudha Sadasivam, S Sangeetha, K Sathiyapriya', 'publication_date': '2012', 'journal': 'Special Issue of International Journal of Computer Applications (0975–8887) on Information Processing and Remote Computing–IPRC', 'total_citations': {'cited_by': {'total': 3, 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1397701149985317172&as_sdt=5', 'serpapi_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=1397701149985317172&engine=google_scholar&hl=en', 'cites_id': '1397701149985317172'}, 'table': [{'year': 2014, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2015, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2016, 'citations': 1}]}}, {'title': 'Protecting the privacy of cancer patients using fuzzy association rule hiding', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857861/', 'resources': [{'title': 'from nih.gov', 'file_format': 'HTML', 'link': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857861/'}], 'authors': 'Sathiyapriya Krishnamoorthy, Kaviya Murugesan', 'publication_date': '2019', 'journal': 'Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention: APJCP', 'publisher': 'Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences', 'description': 'Objective:Privacy protection in the medical field means the protection of individuals from being associated with undesirable conditions, diagnoses or treatments (Sensitive Attributes).

In such places a mass surveillance is required, so in those cases we can use automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technique. Which have difficulties like an illumination in the image, uneven illumination, dim light and foggy conditions make the task of image enhancement even more difficult and recognition of ambiguous like (B-8),(O-0),(I-1),(A-4),(CG),(DO),(KX), and broken characters makes the character recognition challenging.

In such places a mass surveillance is required, so in those cases we can use automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technique. Which have difficulties like an illumination in the image, uneven illumination, dim light and foggy conditions make the task of image enhancement even more difficult and recognition of ambiguous like (B-8),(O-0),(I-1),(A-4),(CG),(DO),(KX), and broken characters makes the character recognition challenging. An ALPR system is developed that will overcome these issues and provide an effective and efficient mass surveillance system.', 'Optic disc segmentation in fundus image is a significant phase in diagnosis of eye disease like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Segmenting the portion of optic disc which is bright yellowish in color is called as optic disc segmentation. Automated optic disc segmentation is essential to diagnose the eye disease at the earliest stage to prevent the eye sight loss. Segmentation of optic disc can be performed using clustering techniques. In this work, hierarchical and partition-based clustering techniques are used to segment the optic disc. Five datasets namely DIARETDB1, CHASE DB, HRF DB, INSPIRE DB, and DRIONS DB are used to evaluate the clustering techniques. A comparative study was made based on the results using the performance parameters like accuracy, error rate, positive predicted value, precision, recall, false discovery rate, and F1 score. The results show that the hierarchical clustering …', 'With the increase in airline transportation, it is necessary to concentrate on delays by Airline Company to improve their business. Passenger may book a flight ticket in a particular airline agency by its reputation in punctuality. They should improve their punctuality by predicting the delay time. To achieve this error rate of delay prediction should be minimized. This paper focuses on predicting and comparing a delay time of a flight with the minimized error rate ie more improved accuracy. The error rate is minimized by automating the prediction model using Artificial Neural Network and also by using ANN with multi core map reduce framework.', 'Image Captioning is the process of creating a text description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision to generate the captions. The image captioning task is done by combining the detection process when the descriptions consist of a single word like cat, skateboard, etc. and Image Captioning when one predicted region covers the full image, for example cat riding a skateboard. To address the localization and description task together, we propose a Fully Convolution Localization Network that processes a picture with a single forward pass which can be consistently trained in a single round of optimization. To process an image, first the input image is processed using CNN. Then Localization Layer proposes regions and includes a region detection network adopted from faster R-CNN and captioning network. The model directly combines the faster R-CNN framework for region detection and long short-term memory (LSTM) for captioning.', 'An isocratic reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed and validated for the determination of rifaximin. Linearity was observed in the concentration range of 1.0–300 μg mL-1 (R2= 0.9998). The LOQ was found to be 0.891 μg mL-1 and the LOD was found to be 0.289 μg mL-1. Rifaximin was subjected to stress conditions of degradation in aqueous solutions including acidic, alkaline, oxidation and thermal degradation. Rifaximin is more sensitive towards oxidation in comparison to other degradations. The method was validated as per ICH guidelines. The RSD for intra-day (0.24-0.55) and inter-day (0.38-0.78) precision were found to be less than 1%. The percentage recovery was in good agreement with the labeled amount in the pharmaceutical formulations and the method is simple, specific, precise, robust and accurate for the determination of Rifaximin in pharmaceutical formulations.', 'Automated localization of the optic disc is an essential phase in automated retinal imaging system, which are used in determining the effect of diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma at their initial phase. In this chapter an unsupervised learning technique called clustering methods are used in localization of optic disc.

The main objective of this paper is to compare and study the drawbacks of the performance of different existing similarity measures against the proposed similarity measure that use the concept of collaborative filtering technique. Methods/Analysis: Collaborative filtering has turned into one of the most used technique to give personalized services for users. The key of this technique is to find alike users or items using user-item rating matrix such that the system can show recommendations for users. Experiments on Web Service (WSDL) data sets are conducted and compared with many traditional similarity measures namely Pearson correlation coefficient, JacUOD, Bhattacharyya coefficient. The result shows the superiority of the proposed similarity model in recommendation performance. Findings: However, existing approaches related to these techniques are derived from similarity algorithms, such as Pearson correlation coefficient, mean squared distance, and cosine. These methods are not much efficient, particularly in the cold user conditions. Applications/Improvement: This paper presents a new user based similarity calculation model to enhance the recommendation performance and to estimate the similarities for each user.

The main objective of this paper is to compare and study the drawbacks of the performance of different existing similarity measures against the proposed similarity measure that use the concept of collaborative filtering technique. Methods/Analysis: Collaborative filtering has turned into one of the most used technique to give personalized services for users. The key of this technique is to find alike users or items using user-item rating matrix such that the system can show recommendations for users. Experiments on Web Service (WSDL) data sets are conducted and compared with many traditional similarity measures namely Pearson correlation coefficient, JacUOD, Bhattacharyya coefficient. The result shows the superiority of the proposed similarity model in recommendation performance. Findings: However, existing approaches related to these techniques are derived from similarity algorithms, such as Pearson correlation coefficient, mean squared distance, and cosine. These methods are not much efficient, particularly in the cold user conditions. Applications/Improvement: This paper presents a new user based similarity calculation model to enhance the recommendation performance and to estimate the similarities for each user. The proposed model incorporates two traditional similarity measures namely Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Jaccard Coefficient.', 'Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used techniques for personalized recommendation services to users, since it can assist users to specify their interest on available items. The key feature of this technique is to find similar users by applying similarity measures on user-item rating matrix. Personalized system can thus provide recommendations for users based on the interest of the active user as well as a likeminded users. The success of the recommendation process depends upon the similarity metric used to find the most similar users. Similarity measures like cosine, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Jaccard Uniform Operator Distance etc are not much effective when user-item rating matrix is sparse. This paper presents a new similarity model to calculate the similarities between each user, when only few ratings are available in the user profile. The proposed model considers both global preference as well as the local context of the user behavior. Experiments are conducted on two different datasets and compared with many existing similarity measures. The results of the experiments show that the proposed similarity measure improves the performance of the personalized recommendation process.', 'Online news article reading has become very popular as the World Wide Web provides an access to variety of news articles from large volume of sources around the world. A key challenge of news portals is to provide articles to the users based on their interest. Personalized news recommendation systems provide news articles to the readers based on their interest rather than presenting articles in order of their occurrences. The effectiveness of news recommendation systems reduces due to lack of user ratings and automated novelty detection. A progressive summary helps a user to monitor changes in news items over a period of time. The automatic detection of novelty in personalized news recommendation system could improve a reader’s search experience by providing news items that add more information’s to already known information’s to the users. This paper presents a rough set based …', 'Traditional news recommendation systems strive to adapt their services to individual users by virtue of both user and news context information. This paper describes personalized news recommendation approach based on dynamic updating policy and collaborative filtering. Adaptive user profiling is a principled framework for news selection based on the intrinsic property of user interest presented, with a good balance between the novelty and diversity of the recommendation result. Also it considers the exclusive characteristics like news context, access patterns, popularity of the news and recency. Collaborative filtering approach can efficiently capture user’s behavior in case where the overlap in historical assumptions across users in relatively high and the context universe is almost static. The major issue with the personalized news recommendation system is scalability. This paper addresses the above mentioned issue with the help of hadoop framework. Experiments on a collection of sports related news obtained from various news websites demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.', 'Agriculture is the keystone of a developing country such as India.

Authentication can be considered as the most critical issue among all the above. So the voters should be kept at the highest priority to make the voting process fair and effective.

A democratic form of government is run by the elected representatives of the common people. Voting is important because the people participate in elections to choose their representatives. Though there are several issues in implementing online voting system, security is one of the most important issues. Our objective is to design and develop a framework for a secure online voting system in a cloud environment by using digital certificate secure hash algorithm (SHA) and ElGamal encryption. The proposed system consists of three managers such as certification authority manager (CAM), Vote manager (VM), and vote tally manager (TM). In registration phase, the elector interacts with CAM to acquire a digital certificate. VM is responsible to authenticate the elector. TM finally tallies the votes. The assessment of the system is verified using …', 'In a cloud based online voting system, the life cycle starts with voter registration, authentication, voting and counting. The election process is a secret process as whole democratic administration is centralised on voting. Authentication, confidentiality, integrity, scalability, speeds and accuracy these are few important criteria to be satisfied by an online voting system. Authentication can be considered as the most critical issue among all the above. So the voters should be kept at the highest priority to make the voting process fair and effective. Through some of the literatures that deal with the issue of authentication mechanisms, the proposed method conceals the original biometric template such that it is impossible to recover the biometric template even when the stored data in the system is open to an attacker. We assess the system with relativity matrix between security requirements, issues, techniques and mechanisms.', 'Online voting guarantees to improve the democratic participation as it allows to cast the votes from remote locations.

To develop this, content based image Retrieval method has played an important role in the field of image retrieval. This paper aims to provide an efficient medical image data Retrieval from a huge content of medical database using one of the images content such as image shape, because, efficient content-based image Retrieval in the medical domain is still a challenging problem. The main objective of this paper is to provide an efficient tool which is used for efficient medical image retrieval from a huge content of medical image database and which is used for further medical diagnosis purposes.', 'A new model based approach for automated generation of test cases in object oriented systems has been presented. The test cases are derived by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the objects due to internal and external stimuli. The scope of the paper has been limited to the object diagrams taken from the Unified Modeling Language model of the system. Genetic Algorithm’s tree crossover has been proposed to bring out all possible test cases of a given object diagram. Illustrative case study has been presented to establish the effectiveness of our methodology coupled with mutation analysis', 'Text classification is enduring to be one of the most researched problems due to continuously-increasing amount of electronic documents and digital data. Naive Bayes is an effective and a simple classifier for data mining tasks, but does not show much satisfactory results in automatic text classification problems. In this paper, the performance of naive Bayes classifier is analyzed by training the classifier with only the positive features selected by CHIR, a statistics based method as input. Feature selection is the most important preprocessing step that improves the efficiency and accuracy of text classification algorithms by removing redundant and irrelevant terms from the training corpus. Experiments were conducted for randomly selected training sets and the performance of the classifier with words as features was analyzed. The proposed method achieves higher classification accuracy compared to other native …', 'The accumulation of large collections of digital images has created the need for efficient and intelligent schemes for classifying and retrieval of images. In this work,“CBMIR: Shape-Based Image Retrieval Using Canny Edge Detection and K-Means Clustering Algorithms for Medical Images”, has been developed to retrieve the medical images from huge volume of medical databases. This requires the preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, retrieval and indexing steps in order to develop an efficient medical image retrieval system. In this work, for preprocessing step, the image segmentation method has been carried out, for feature extraction, basic shape feature has been extracted using canny edge detection algorithm, and for classification, K-means classification algorithm has been used. For retrieval of images, Euclidian distance method values are calculated between query image and database images. The goal of this work is to provide a medical image retrieval system for further use of medical diagnosis purpose in the field of medical domain.', 'Feature selection is an indispensable preprocessing step for effective analysis of high dimensional data. It removes irrelevant features, improves the predictive accuracy and increases the comprehensibility of the model constructed by the classifiers sensitive to features. Finding an optimal feature subset for a problem in an outsized domain becomes intractable and many such feature selection problems have been shown to be NP-hard. Optimization algorithms are frequently designed for NP-hard problems to find nearly optimal solutions with a practical time complexity. This paper formulates the text feature selection problem as a combinatorial problem and proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to find the nearly optimal solution for the same. It differs from the earlier algorithm by Aghdam et al. by including a heuristic function based on statistics and a local search. The algorithm aims at determining a …', 'Problem statement: Recently, there has been a huge progress in collection of varied image databases in the form of digital. Most of the users found it difficult to search and retrieve required images in large collections. In order to provide an effective and efficient search engine tool, the system has been implemented. In image retrieval system, there is no methodologies have been considered directly to retrieve the images from databases. Instead of that, various visual features that have been considered indirect to retrieve the images from databases. In this system, one of the visual features such as texture that has been considered indirectly into images to extract the feature of the image. That featured images only have been considered for the retrieval process in order to retrieve exact desired images from the databases. Approach: The aim of this study is to construct an efficient image retrieval tool namely,“Content Based Medical Image Retrieval with Texture Content using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and k-Means Clustering algorithms”. This image retrieval tool is capable of retrieving images based on the texture feature of the image and it takes into account the Preprocessing, feature extraction, Classification and retrieval steps in order to construct an efficient retrieval tool. The main feature of this tool is used of GLCM of the extracting texture pattern of the image and k-means clustering algorithm for image classification in order to improve retrieval efficiency. The proposed image retrieval system consists of three stages ie, segmentation, texture feature extraction and clustering process. In the segmentation process, preprocessing step to …', 'Image retrieval systems attempt to search through a database to find images that are perceptually similar to a query image. This work aims to develop an efficient visual-Content-based technique to search, browse and retrieve relevant images from large-scale of medical image collections Features play a vital role during the image retrieval. The various features that can be extracted are texture, color, intensity, shape, resolution, global and local features etc. In this work, we concentrate on the specific medical domain. The features such as color may not prove to be a very efficient method because the medical domain largely deals with the gray scale images. The features explored in this work are intensity, texture. The first step is to extract the texture feature and the intensity feature from the given input image. Then the both features are combined to form the single feature vector of the image by using the fusion …', 'Weighted association rule mining reflects semantic significance of item by considering its weight. Classification constructs the classifier and predicts the new data instance. This paper proposes compact weighted class association rule mining method, which applies weighted association rule mining in the classification and constructs an efficient weighted associative classifier. This proposed associative classification algorithm chooses one non class informative attribute from dataset and all the weighted class association rules are generated based on that attribute. The weight of the item is considered as one of the parameter in generating the weighted class association rules. This proposed algorithm calculates the weight using the HITS model. Experimental results show that the proposed system generates less number of high quality rules which improves the classification accuracy.', 'Problem statement: The problem is to classify a given web query to a set of 67 target categories. The target categories are ranked based on the degree of similarity to a given query. Approach: The feature set is the set of intermediate categories retrieved from a directory search engine for a given query. Using direct mapping and Normalized Web Distance (NWD) the intermediate categories are mapped to the required target categories. The categories are then ranked based on three parameters of the intermediate categories namely, position, frequency and a combination of frequency and position.

This may lead to Opinion Spam, where spammers may manipulate and fake reviews to promote artificially or devalue the products and other services. Opinion spam detection is done by extracting meaningful features from the text, and identifying the spam reviews using machine learning techniques. This representation results in a very high dimensional feature space. These features are irrelevant, redundant, and noisy which may affect the performance of the classifier. Therefore, a good feature selection method is needed in order to speed up the processing rate, predictive accuracy. Evolutionary algorithms for feature selection can be used to handle these high-dimensional feature …']","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004579061731193X', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-017-0798-3', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10798587.2017.1364931', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004579061830329X', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8431153/', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-15416-5_1', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-8681-6_36', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8094094/', '', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7972369/']","[['art mobile social networks', 'social cognitive handover', 'social relationship', 'social language', 'various handover issues', 'mobile users', 'data delivery services', 'efficient spectrum utilization', 'prevailing spectrum underutilization', 'social data and mobile communication network'], ['cognitive computing systems', 'secondary users', 'new computing models', 'spectrum handovers', 'primary user', 'advertent primary users', 'Cognitive communication model', 'cognitive radio networks abetment', 'cognitive radio', 'Cognitive wireless network'], ['cognitive users', 'cognitive users increases', 'licensed users', 'cooperative spectrum sensing', 'spectrum sensing', 'cognitive radio networks', 'Cognitive radio systems', 'cognitive radios', 'detection', 'any primary users'], ['product reviews', 'optimized feature subsets', 'trustworthy reviews', 'fake reviews', 'products', 'spammy contents', 'frog leaping algorithm', 'high dimensionality', 'improved binary particle swarm optimization', 'blogs'], ['Heart disease', 'heart diseases', 'heart attack', 'high death rate', 'disastrous consequences', 'poor clinical decisions', 'hospital information systems', 'appropriate decision support systems', 'clinical tests', 'medical data'], ['cognitive network security challenges', 'Cognitive radio networks', 'cognitive network architecture protocol design', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive radio domains', 'Dynamic Spectrum Allocation', 'systems', 'cooperative communications', 'major performance gains', 'dynamic adaptation algorithms'], ['cognitive radio networks', 'unlimited access', 'one network', 'the network', 'future supporting mobility', '802.16e standard', 'end', 'data loss', 'mobile TCP', 'Mobility'], ['higher classification accuracy', 'false reviews', 'Online Reviews', 'Adaptive Binary Flower Pollination Algorithm', 'classification', 'Feature selection', 'a global optimization technique', 'features', 'Review Spam', 'BFPA'], [], ['online review resources', 'online reviews', 'meaningful features', 'feature selection', 'Opinion spam detection', 'machine learning techniques', 'predictive accuracy', 'other services', 'customer opinion', 'service']]"

This paper suggests three approaches for security enhancement …', 'With the tremendous growth of technology, providing data security to critical applications such as smart grid, health care, and military is indispensable. On the other hand, due to the proliferation of external data threats in these applications, the loss incurred is incredibly high. Standard encryption algorithms such as RSA, ElGamal, and ECC facilitate in protecting sensitive data from outside attackers; however, they cannot perform computations on sensitive data while being encrypted. To perform computations and to process encrypted query on encrypted data, various homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes are proposed. Each of the schemes has its own shortcomings either related to performance or with storage that acts as the barrier for applying in real-time applications. With that conception, our objective is to design HE schemes that are simple by design, efficient in performance, and highly unimpeachable against …', 'Background/Objective: In Software Effort Estimation (SEE), predicting the amount of time taken in human hours or months for software development is considered as a cumbersome process. SEE consists of both Software Development Effort Estimation (SDEE) and Software Maintenance Effort Estimation (SMEE). Over estimation or under estimation of software effort results in project cancellation or project failure. The objective of this study is to identify the best performing model for software Effort Estimation through experimental comparison with various Machine learning algorithms. Methods: Software Effort Estimation was addressed by using various machine learning techniques such as Multilinear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic-Net Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and NeuralNet to recognize best performing model. Datasets used are Desharnais, Maxwell, China and Albrecht datasets. Evaluation metrics considered are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-Squared. Findings: Experiments on various machine learning algorithms for software Effort Estimation determines that Support Vector Machine produced the best performance comparatively with other algorithms.', 'A key initiative taken by Government of India in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Digital India” move is the formation of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem for smart healthcare. Any security flaw occurring during authentication with a centralized environment affects the connectivity of devices in the network and the transaction of data in IoT. As a solution, Blockchain technology emerges to use in IoT network for the betterment. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare IT systems. In IoMT environment, a private Blockchain network is created containing all the participants of a hospital including doctors, lab technicians, patients and clinical laboratories etc., There exists no necessity to carry the report by the patients during every visit, as the data is already available in the network. The data is completely decentralized to avoid failure …', 'In large-scale distributed systems, where adversarial attacks have extensive impact, authentication provides fortification against threats involving impersonation of entities and tampering of data. Towards this, we introduce the first tetrahedron (three-dimensional (3D)) based two-server Password Authenticated and Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol to represent text passwords. A 3D PAKE protocol is a hybrid cryptographic algorithm that requires two servers for authentication; one server engages with users and the other is hidden from the clients. A remarkable aspect of the proposed 3D PAKE protocol is that reclaiming password from the stored credentials is not possible when either one/both the servers gets compromised. In this paper, we discuss the properties of tetrahedron that mesh well with Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol and elliptic curve cryptography encryption scheme and proved that the protocol is …', 'Software Project Estimation is a challenging and important activity in developing software projects. Software Project Estimation includes Software Time Estimation, Software Resource Estimation, Software Cost Estimation, and Software Effort Estimation. Software Effort Estimation focuses on predicting the number of hours of work (effort in terms of person-hours or person-months) required to develop or maintain a software application. It is difficult to forecast effort during the initial stages of software development. Various machine learning and deep learning models have been developed to predict the effort estimation. In this paper, single model approaches and ensemble approaches were considered for estimation. Ensemble techniques are the combination of several single models. Ensemble techniques considered for estimation were averaging, weighted averaging, bagging, boosting, and stacking. Various stacking …', 'Artificial Intelligence is a superset of Machine Learning and Deep learning, used to build intelligent systems that can solve problems. Software Effort Estimation is used to predict the number of hours of work required to complete the task. It is difficult and a challenging task to forecast Software Effort in the project during initial stages, due to several uncertainties. Software Effort Estimation helps in planning, scheduling, budgeting a project. Various experiments were proposed to predict effort alike expert judgment, analogy based estimations, regression estimations, classification approaches, deep learning algorithms. In this paper, comparison of deepnet, neuralnet, support vector machine and random forest algorithms were carried out and the results show that random forest outperforms other algorithms because of its robustness and capacity to handle large datasets. Evaluation metrics deliberated are Mean Absolute …', 'As 5G transitions from an industrial vision to a tangible, next-generation mobile technology, security remains key business driver. Heterogeneous environment, new networking paradigms and novel use cases makes 5G vulnerable to new security threats. This in turn necessitates a flexible and dependable security mechanism. End-to-End (E2E) data protection provides better security, avoids repeated security operations like encryption/decryption and provides differentiated security based on the services. E2E security deals with authentication, integrity, key management and confidentiality. The attack surface of a 5G system is larger as 5G aims for a heterogeneous networked society. Hence attack resistance needs to be a design consideration when defining new 5G protocols. This framework has been designed for accessing the manifold applications with high security and trust by offering E2E security for various …', 'Homomorphic encryption (HE) is an emerging scheme that allows computation over encrypted data. The standard encryption algorithms like RSA, Elgamal, etc. help in protecting confidential data from attackers rather than performing computation over encrypted data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) permits computation to perform upon encrypted data unlimitedly in server side than in computational node. In this paper, the basic DGHV FHE scheme and NTRU FHE scheme are analyzed to preserve the security and privacy of the data. DGHV performs computing over real integers, while NTRU in a truncated polynomial ring. A detailed investigation of both the schemes is based on the storage and noise reduction that best suits for a real-world application.', '']","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6354591/', 'https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/big.2021.0012', 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/58bc/d0cf9761c5a3c5290686d5dfb08293fb6dd3.pdf', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-33596-0_12', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03772063.2016.1176539', 'https://search.proquest.com/openview/339884a8def03aba2813d0614a791fa3/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2032404', 'https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1767/1/012019/meta', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8552296/', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24051-6_61', 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10598718328624769100&hl=en&oi=scholarr']","[['hadoop clusters', 'hadoop environment', 'multiple Backend Servers', 'Backend Servers', 'significant security challenge', 'block locations', 'security enhancement', 'Authentication', 'the hadoop cluster', 'Authentication and Backend servers'], ['sensitive data', 'encrypted data', 'critical applications', 'data security', 'external data threats', 'various homomorphic encryption', 'smart grid', 'health care', 'encrypted query', 'outside attackers'], ['software Effort Estimation', 'Mean Squared Error', 'Effort Estimation', 'Software Effort Estimation', 'Root Mean Square Error', 'Software Maintenance Effort Estimation', 'various Machine learning algorithms', 'Mean Absolute Error', 'various machine learning algorithms', 'Support Vector Machine'], ['IoT network', 'smart healthcare', 'patients', 'clinical laboratories', 'Blockchain technology', 'lab technicians', 'IT systems', 'Digital India', 'IoT', 'medical devices'], ['Hellman key exchange protocol', 'text passwords', 'elliptic curve cryptography encryption scheme', 'password', 'data', 'authentication', 'extensive impact', 'the proposed 3D PAKE protocol', 'tampering', 'A 3D PAKE protocol'], ['software development', 'software projects', 'Software Effort Estimation', 'Software Cost Estimation', 'Software Resource Estimation', 'Software Time Estimation', 'Software Project Estimation', 'single model approaches', 'deep learning models', 'several single models'], ['random forest algorithms', 'deep learning algorithms', 'large datasets', 'other algorithms', 'several uncertainties', 'analogy based estimations', 'Software Effort Estimation', 'regression estimations', 'Software Effort', 'Deep learning'], ['new security threats', 'differentiated security', 'E2E security', 'repeated security operations', 'better security', 'security', 'high security', 'E2E security deals', 'key business driver', 'key management'], ['encrypted data', 'confidential data', 'computational node', 'NTRU FHE scheme', 'server side', 'computation', 'real integers', 'NTRU FHE', 'attackers', 'NTRU'], []]"

The flaws in the e-mail protocols and the increasing amount of electronic business and financial transactions directly contribute to the increase in e-mail-based threats. Email spam is one of the major problems of the today's Internet, bringing financial damage to companies and annoying individual users. Spam emails are invading users without their consent and filling their mail boxes. They consume more network capacity as well as time in checking and deleting spam mails.

E-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, etc provide customers with a forum to share their experience and provide potential consumers with true evidence of the product's outcomes.

In the proposed work, Sentiment Analysis is to be done on the consumer review data and categorize into positive and negative feelings. Naïve Bayes Classification, LSTM and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed for the classification of reviews from the various classification models.

Among the many proposed solutions, a technique using Bayesian filtering is considered as the most effective weapon against spam. Bayesian filtering works by evaluating the probability of different words appearing in legitimate and spam mails and then classifying them based on that probabilities. Most of the current spam email detection systems use keywords to detect spam emails. These', 'In recent days, Electronic mail system is a store and forward mechanism used for the purpose of exchanging documents across computer network through Internet. Spam is an unwanted mail which contains unsolicited and harmful data that are irrelevant to the specified users.

Quantization tables in the JPEG scheme is a key factor that is responsible for compression/quality trade-off. Finding the optimal quantization table is an open research problem. Studies recommend the genetic algorithm to generate the optimal solution. Recent reports revealed optimal quantization table generation based on a classical genetic algorithm (CGA). Although the CGA produces better results, it shows inefficiency in terms of convergence speed and productivity of feasible solutions. This paper proposes a knowledge-based genetic algorithm (KBGA), which combines the image characteristics and knowledge about image compressibility with CGA operators such as initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation for searching for the optimal quantization table. The experimental results show that the optimal quantization table generated using the proposed KBGA outperforms the default JPEG quantization table in terms of mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for target bits per pixel. The KBGA was also tested on a variety of images in three different bits values per pixel to show its strength. The proposed KBGA produces an average PSNR gain of 3.3% and average MSE gain of 20.6% over the default JPEG quantization table. The performance measures such as average unfitness value, likelihood of evolution leap, and likelihood of optimality are used to validate the efficacy of the proposed KBGA. The novelty of the KBGA lies in the number of generations used to attain an optimal solution as compared to the CGA.

Clustering the blocks of an image into meaningful groups to reveal useful information is a challenging problem. This paper uses Partitional algorithm for image block clustering and also clusters are arranged in a hierarchical structure to explore the different aspects of the data. K Means algorithm is a widely used Partitional algorithm. But due to its gradient descent nature, the result of this algorithm is very sensitive to the initial cluster centroids which do not produce unique clustering results every time for the same input. Many initialization methods have been proposed to address this problem, but it produces results at the cost of high computational time. A Deterministic Centroid Initialization Method (DCIM) was proposed in our earlier work for K means Clustering algorithm which was used to cluster the image blocks for content adaptive image compression. In this paper, we extend the performance analysis part of DCIM in conventional K Means and Fuzzy C Means algorithm. The performance analysis has been done with the measures such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Number of iterations and CPU time. The strength of this DCIM method is that the clustering algorithms require less number of iterations to attain convergence and in producing the unique better clustering result in a single run.

Early detection and treatment for these diseases can prevent blindness. Computer-aided diagnostic retinal image analysis is needed to facilitate the ophthalmologist for automating the mass screening process to detect these diseases. The optic disc is the brightest part of the retinal image and is a pale, well-defined round or vertically slightly oval disc. Pathologies like exudates and lesions in the eye images may look like as optic disc (OD) shape. Optic disc segmentation is the first step in developing the computer-aided diagnostic system.

This paper proposes a classical differential evolution (CDE) algorithm for finding the optimal luminance quantisation table for a target bits/pixel (bpp). Also, it aims to carry out an extensive performance comparison of the CDE algorithm with the classical genetic algorithm (CGA). It is observed that the CDE-based quantisation table outperforms the default JPEG and CGA-based quantisation tables in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Images with different complexity levels have been experimented with both CDE and CGA algorithms. The validation results show that CDE guarantees a feasible solution in faster convergence rate than CGA.

Quantization tables in the JPEG scheme is a key factor that is responsible for compression/quality trade-off. Finding the optimal quantization table is an open research problem. Studies recommend the genetic algorithm to generate the optimal solution. Recent reports revealed optimal quantization table generation based on a classical genetic algorithm (CGA). Although the CGA produces better results, it shows inefficiency in terms of convergence speed and productivity of feasible solutions. This paper proposes a knowledge-based genetic algorithm (KBGA), which combines the image characteristics and knowledge about image compressibility with CGA operators such as initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation for searching for the optimal quantization table. The experimental results show that the optimal quantization table generated using the proposed KBGA outperforms the default JPEG quantization table in terms of mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for target bits per pixel. The KBGA was also tested on a variety of images in three different bits values per pixel to show its strength. The proposed KBGA produces an average PSNR gain of 3.3% and average MSE gain of 20.6% over the default JPEG quantization table. The performance measures such as average unfitness value, likelihood of evolution leap, and likelihood of optimality are used to validate the efficacy of the proposed KBGA. The novelty of the KBGA lies in the number of generations used to attain an optimal solution as compared to the CGA.

With the technological enhancements and scientific growth, AI turns out to be a field of interest. Thus, it leads to the amplified focus on machine learning (ML) techniques. Machine learning (ML) is the most important data analysis methods which iteratively learn from the available data by using learning algorithms. The present survey provides the theoretical representation and basic methodologies of machine learning techniques like support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbours (KNNs), decision tree, Bayesian networks, clustering, hidden Markov model (HMM) and neural networks.

Clustering the blocks of an image into meaningful groups to reveal useful information is a challenging problem. This paper uses Partitional algorithm for image block clustering and also clusters are arranged in a hierarchical structure to explore the different aspects of the data. K Means algorithm is a widely used Partitional algorithm. But due to its gradient descent nature, the result of this algorithm is very sensitive to the initial cluster centroids which do not produce unique clustering results every time for the same input. Many initialization methods have been proposed to address this problem, but it produces results at the cost of high computational time. A Deterministic Centroid Initialization Method (DCIM) was proposed in our earlier work for K means Clustering algorithm which was used to cluster the image blocks for content adaptive image compression. In this paper, we extend the performance analysis part of DCIM in conventional K Means and Fuzzy C Means algorithm. The performance analysis has been done with the measures such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Number of iterations and CPU time. The strength of this DCIM method is that the clustering algorithms require less number of iterations to attain convergence and in producing the unique better clustering result in a single run. Clustering algorithms with DCIM was tested on a variety of images to show its strength. The experimental results show that the clustering algorithm with DCIM outperforms the clustering …', 'Digital retinal images are widely used for detection of eye diseases, such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO)[1], out of all diseases, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death among humans globally. The 2019 annual report about heart disease [2] says that CVD is one of the major causes of death in the US. Out of nearly 840,768 deaths in 2016, 635,260 demises were due to CVD. Though the death rate has decreased nowadays, still it requires more attention. Nowadays, patients’ health is being monitored remotely using IoT technologies and devices. This enables the doctors to take care of patients all the time without actually being physically present. The communication between the doctor and patient becomes easier and more efficient than with the traditional system where the patient needs to meet the doctor in person often. This is a time-consuming process. The era of the IoT has made the healthcare system smarter. Figure 8.1 shows the general process involved in the IoT healthcare system.The objectives of this chapter are to analyse how efficiently IoT can play a role in healthcare systems, especially for CVD, to review the machine learning (ML) algorithms used in this field, and to provide the abstraction of edge/fog computing in the IoT healthcare field.

Since the sensor nodes have limited capacity, single path routing does not suite to transfer video content.

However not all the path in multipath routing is suited for video transmission because one or few path may not have sufficient energy to transfer the video stream, but it can able to transfer data stream. Based on the application, the type of data either video stream or data stream plays a different role. Significance levels are different for each of its data type. Priority for the data is to be given based on their significance level. In this paper, a novel approach called Efficient Priority Based Multipath Routing (EPBMR) is proposed which optimizes the multiple disjoint path found from Cost Based Multipath Routing (CBMR) by giving priority to the cost of each disjoint path and type of data.

The main problem is location and the accessibility, people are suffering to go to their native place polling booth for casting their vote. This needs to be considered as every people`s vote plays significant role in deciding the right leaders. Blockchain technology offers the transparency and security requisites for the impartial election. It is a complete decentralized, immutable ledger system. The online voting system allows the voters to cast their vote from any place at any time which leads to increasing the voter participation count …', ""Most of the metropolitan cities facing the problem of collecting garbage on time. Due to the inadequacy of garbage collection, the trash bin gets overflow and causes various risk such as spreading diseases, unpleasant aroma, ugliness, etc. To evade all these circumstances, this paper addresses the efficient collection of garbage's by implementing IoT based smart trash can system. This system monitor the overall status of all trash cans around the city. Whenever the trash level of bin reaches the threshold level it sends the alert message to the truck driver. It also helps the garbage truck driver by providing him with the shortest path to attend all trash cans in city. IoT based smart trashcan is implemented using Raspberry Pi board with HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor for measuring trash level.

This paper is about a prediction score analysis and results analysis of various research papers and research articles and building best prediction model on machine Learning based Diabetes Prediction. From the studies, popular ML algorithms including Decision Tree, RF Classifier, SVM, K-NN, Naïve Bayes and deep learning algorithm MLP classifier have been analyzed based on the accuracy scores and other evaluation metrics scores obtained based on the prediction.', ""Nowadays, healthcare systems using the IoT are making a huge difference compared with the existing healthcare systems. Healthcare using IoT provides the easiest way of communication between the patient and doctors, where the doctor monitors the patient's health remotely. The patient's health is being monitored through the IoT device, which in turn produces the data pertaining to the human body's health. Based on the data received from the IoT device, the doctors can diagnose patient health in real-time. Diagnosis and prediction of disease can be done through machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML techniques help to minimize the future recurrence by alerting the doctor and identifying the risk factors for a patient's health. They use classification algorithms, such as the random forest algorithm, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), for diagnosis and prediction. The health data received from the IoT device must …"", 'In general, the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare systems has benefits such as: i) the workload of doctors, nurses, or medical practitioners is reduced, ii) it makes healthcare more reasonable, iii) it makes doctors more approachable and accessible for rural patients, and iv) it encourages progress in medical technology. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)[1], out of all diseases, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death among humans globally. The 2019 annual report about heart disease [2] says that CVD is one of the major causes of death in the US. Out of nearly 840,768 deaths in 2016, 635,260 demises were due to CVD. Though the death rate has decreased nowadays, still it requires more attention. Nowadays, patients’ health is being monitored remotely using IoT technologies and devices. This enables the doctors to take care of patients all the time without actually being physically present. The communication between the doctor and patient becomes easier and more efficient than with the traditional system where the patient needs to meet the doctor in person often. This is a time-consuming process. The era of the IoT has made the healthcare system smarter. Figure 8.1 shows the general process involved in the IoT healthcare system.The objectives of this chapter are to analyse how efficiently IoT can play a role in healthcare systems, especially for CVD, to review the machine learning (ML) algorithms used in this field, and to provide the abstraction of edge/fog computing in the IoT healthcare field. Section 8.2 brief discusses CVD and its types. Section 8.3 describes the motivation and classification. Section 8.4 …', 'This chapter presents a dynamic traffic light scheduling system, which schedules the time of the traffic light controller on each side. Each emergency vehicle is assigned with priority and it has a unique identity (ID) by default. The unique ID and the priority are used to process the request from each vehicle. In the case of priority, conflict distance is considered for scheduling. Various technologies like ZigBee, LoRaWAN are used to provide cost-effective solutions. ZigBee is one of the high-level communication protocol in IEEE 802.15.4. It works at low power, and it has low data rate. ZigBee has a range of 10–100 meters with line of sight communication. The rate of data transmission in ZigBee is 250 kb/s.', 'Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) refers to a group of spatially deployed sensors that are used to sense or detect phenomena. In the recent years, there is an increase in the adoption of Wireless Sensor Network. The sensor device which is tiny in size and lower in cost, can deploy thousand to million nodes in a particular area. It plays a major role in various applications such as area monitoring, health care monitoring, forest fire detection, landslide detection, water quality monitoring and natural disaster prevention. The important contribution of the sensor nodes in the above mentioned application is to sense the environmental changes or an unexpected event occurred in the target area and to send the sensed data to the sink node /Base Station (BS). Resource limitations of the sensor node and unreliability of low power wireless links, in combination with various performance …', '', 'Monitoring the target area lively by video sensor node will improve the ability of event description. Since the sensor nodes have limited capacity, single path routing does not suite to transfer video content. Accordingly there is a need for multipath routing for efficient transmission of video content. However not all the path in multipath routing is suited for video transmission because one or few path may not have sufficient energy to transfer the video stream, but it can able to transfer data stream. Based on the application, the type of data either video stream or data stream plays a different role. Significance levels are different for each of its data type. Priority for the data is to be given based on their significance level. In this paper, a novel approach called Efficient Priority Based Multipath Routing (EPBMR) is proposed which optimizes the multiple disjoint path found from Cost Based Multipath Routing (CBMR) by giving priority to the cost of each disjoint path and type of data. The results show that EPBMR can able to choose maximum number of path based on the priority.']","['https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6203845/', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12046-018-0984-x', '', 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10990444057708685878&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19562-5_16', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9784968/', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9441912/', 'https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJENM.2019.103154', 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9785280/', 'https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003009092-8/real-time-cardiovascular-health-monitoring-system-using-iot-machine-learning-algorithms-vairam-sarathambekai-umamaheswari-jothibanu-manojkumar', 'https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Hj0LEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA145&dq=info:_E7T_N5yFIEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ChaVC0hIf4&sig=lWjE0Izt8AmemtnnRv_9-PG5m7w', 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24051-6_65', 'http://ir.psgtech.ac.in/jspui/handle/123456789/136', '', 'https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7bf809957acc2826e869f75b1503a03fa0669dad']","[['Multi-path routing', 'single path routing', 'multiple disjoint path routing', 'Routing protocols', 'new routing protocols', 'network cameras', 'maximum packet delivery ratio', 'limited transmission range', 'goodput', 'wireless sensor application'], ['discrete optimization problems', 'premature convergence problem', 'NP', 'reliability cost', 'Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization', 'Cyber Swarm Algorithm', 'DPSO', 'multiprocessor computing systems', 'benchmark instances', 'a complex combinatorial optimization problem'], [], [], ['electricity resource management', 'traffic management', 'environment management', 'efficient network', 'water-resource management', 'network devices', 'health care', 'agriculture', 'ICT', 'more advantages'], ['credit card fraud detection applications', 'more value', 'more demand', 'Fraudulent transactions', 'fraudulent transactions', 'Machine Learning Techniques', 'Data Science', 'Credit Card Fraud Detection', 'Debit card and credit card', 'net banking'], ['Electronic voting system', 'old paper ballot system', 'the voter participation count', 'significant role', 'an electronic voting system', 'a different voting system', 'The online voting system', 'their native place polling booth', 'these voting systems', 'a long time'], ['trash level', 'city', 'garbage collection', 'HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor', 'garbage', 'unpleasant aroma', 'ugliness', 'IoT based smart trashcan', 'Raspberry Pi board', 'various risk'], ['Learning based Diabetes Prediction', 'other evaluation metrics scores', 'deep learning algorithm MLP classifier', 'useful information', 'best prediction model', 'health care', 'banking sector', 'various research papers', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Naïve Bayes'], ['patient health', 'doctors', 'IoT', 'healthcare systems', 'classification algorithms', 'The health data', 'prediction', 'ML', 'Diagnosis', 'diagnosis'], ['healthcare systems', 'healthcare', 'IoT technologies', 'medical technology', 'rural patients', 'doctors', 'CVD', 'IoT', 'the IoT healthcare system', 'medical practitioners'], ['IEEE 802.15.4', 'sight communication', 'scheduling', 'low data rate', 'a dynamic traffic light scheduling system', 'priority', 'the traffic light controller', '10–100 meters', 'data transmission', 'ZigBee'], ['area monitoring', 'health care monitoring', 'water quality monitoring', 'forest fire detection', 'natural disaster prevention', 'landslide detection', 'various applications', 'various performance', 'low power wireless links', 'a particular area'], [], ['data stream', 'video content', 'video transmission', 'single path routing', 'data', 'video sensor node', 'path', 'Cost Based Multipath Routing', 'Based Multipath Routing', 'type']]"

Each particle inside the swarm belongs to a specific topology for communicating with neighboring particles in the swarm.

This type of problem can be resolved by heuristic algorithms efficiently because the traditional methods such as dynamic programming and the back tracking need more time for solving this NP complete problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a newly developed meta-heuristic global optimization technique. It was originally designed only for continuous optimization problems. In task scheduling, the particles are represented as discrete values. It is obvious that the classical PSO cannot be used to solve discrete problems directly because its positions are real-valued. Some conversion techniques are needed to operate PSO in discrete domain. This paper presents a modified PSO called Discrete PSO (DPSO). In DPSO, no conversion techniques are needed because the velocity and positions are redefined to operate the PSO in a discrete domain directly. In this paper, the scheduler aims at minimizing make span, flow time and reliability cost simultaneously in distributed systems for scheduling of independent tasks using DPSO.

This type of problem can be resolved by heuristic algorithms efficiently because the traditional methods such as dynamic programming and the back tracking need more time for solving this NP complete problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a newly developed meta-heuristic global optimization technique. It was originally designed only for continuous optimization problems. In task scheduling, the particles are represented as discrete values. It is obvious that the classical PSO cannot be used to solve discrete problems directly because its positions are real-valued. Some conversion techniques are needed to operate PSO in discrete domain. This paper presents a modified PSO called Discrete PSO (DPSO). In DPSO, no conversion techniques are needed because the velocity and positions are redefined to operate the PSO in a discrete domain directly. In this paper, the scheduler aims at minimizing make span, flow time and reliability cost simultaneously in distributed systems for scheduling of independent tasks using DPSO.

InterPulsed Interval (IPI) of the ECG signal is considered as a biometric characteristic for key generation because of its high randomness, time variance properties and also to avoid interference between the other BSNs. The body sensor node to base station (PDA or Laptop) communication has been secured using the symmetric cryptographic algorithm AES and integrity is checked by using the Message Authentication Code (MAC). Steganography is used for securing the data transfer between base station and medical server. In this work, we have embedded the medical data (Blood Pressure) within the patients’ facial image. The face image is selected as a cover image in order to provide authentication. The pixel positions for embedding the medical data are determined by fixing a threshold level (120-126). This threshold value is chosen so as to have high random distribution throughout the image. The results have been shown using MATLAB 7.8. 0.', 'Solid waste management is an essential task to be carried out in day-to-day life. So an automated recognition system using deep learning algorithm has been implemented to classify wastes as biodegradable and non-biodegradable. Efficient segregation of solid wastes helps to reduce the amount of waste buried in the ground, thereby improving the recycling rate, and safeguards the soil from pollution.', 'Background. Automation in cardiac arrhythmia classification helps medical professionals make accurate decisions about the patient’s health.Objectives. The aim of this work was to design a hybrid classification model to classify cardiac arrhythmias.Material and methods. The design phase of the classification model comprises the following stages: preprocessing of the cardiac signal by eliminating detail coefficients that contain noise, feature extraction through Daubechies wavelet transform, and arrhythmia classification using a collaborative decision from the K nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) and a support vector machine (SVM). The proposed model is able to classify 5 arrhythmia classes as per the ANSI/AAMI EC57: 1998 classification standard. Level 1 of the proposed model involves classification using the KNN and the classifier is trained with examples from all classes. Level 2 involves classification using an SVM and is trained specifically to classify overlapped classes. The final classification of a test heartbeat pertaining to a particular class is done using the proposed KNN/SVM hybrid model.Results. The experimental results demonstrated that the average sensitivity of the proposed model was 92.56%, the average specificity 99.35%, the average positive predictive value 98.13%, the average F-score 94.5%, and the average accuracy 99.78%.Conclusions. The results obtained using the proposed model were compared with the results of discriminant, tree, and KNN classifiers. The proposed model is able to achieve a high classification accuracy.', 'Embedding the original high dimensional data in a low dimensional space helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality and removes noise. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of three different linear dimensionality reduction techniques (DR) techniques namely principal component analysis (PCA), multi dimensional scaling (MDS) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on classification of cardiac arrhythmias using probabilistic neural network classifier (PNN). The design phase of classification model comprises of the following stages: preprocessing of the cardiac signal by eliminating detail coefficients that contain noise, feature extraction through daubechies wavelet transform, dimensionality reduction through linear DR techniques specified, and arrhythmia classification using PNN. Linear dimensionality reduction techniques have simple geometric representations and simple computational properties. Entire MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used for experimentation. The experimental results demonstrates that combination of PNN classifier (spread parameter, σ = 0.08) and PCA DR technique exhibits highest sensitivity and F score of 78.84% and 78.82% respectively with a minimum of 8 dimensions.', 'Heart disease increases the mortality rate in the recent years across the world.

Consumers are the king of the market. For-profit organizations cannot function without customers. All the activities of the company end with the consumer and their satisfaction. Consumer behavior is the study of consumers and how they choose or eliminate products. This theory extends not only to products but also to services consumed. To develop a framework for studying consumer behavior, first look at the factors that influence consumer buying behavior, as well as the various thinking paradigms that have influenced the progress and discipline of consumer research. Modeling customer behavior is nothing more than creating a mathematical structure to map the general behavior of a particular customer group. This is done to predict how consumers will react in a particular situation. The purpose of the survey is to better understand consumer behavior by examining the factors that influence the consumer's purchasing process. The main purpose of studying consumer behavior is to understand how consumers feel and think. Building a recommendation engine is another application for studying consumer behavior. The recommendation engine basically recommends several products based on a variety of factors, including previous purchases by consumers, age, etc. It's a kind of data filtering tool that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a particular customer.

The number of casualties in India owing to chronic disease was anticipated to be 5.21 million in 2008 and is likely to increase from over 7.63 million by 2020. There are five distinct stages of disease development in which each stage increases in severity while as it advances between stage 1 and stage 5. Stage 1 is when a person's kidney function falls below normal. As the affected individuals it goes ahead into step 2, they may experience a mild to moderate loss of renal functions. The worsening condition escalates in level 3, where there is a moderate to average deterioration in the nephrological operation followed by acute damage in the functioning of the excretory system in stage 4.

The majority of emotional traits, on the other hand, are sensitive to emotionally neutral elements like the speaker, speaking manner, and gender. In this work, we postulate that computing deltas for individual features maintain useful information which is mainly relevant to emotional traits while it minimizes the loss of emotionally irrelevant components, thus leading to fewer misclassifications. Additionally, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) commonly experiences silent and emotionally unrelated frames. The proposed technique is quite good at picking up important feature representations for emotion relevant features. So here is a two dimensional convolutional recurrent neural network that is attention-based to learn distinguishing characteristics and predict the emotions.

Consumers are the king of the market. For-profit organizations cannot function without customers. All the activities of the company end with the consumer and their satisfaction. Consumer behavior is the study of consumers and how they choose or eliminate products. This theory extends not only to products but also to services consumed. To develop a framework for studying consumer behavior, first look at the factors that influence consumer buying behavior, as well as the various thinking paradigms that have influenced the progress and discipline of consumer research. Modeling customer behavior is nothing more than creating a mathematical structure to map the general behavior of a particular customer group. This is done to predict how consumers will react in a particular situation. The purpose of the survey is to better understand consumer behavior by examining the factors that influence the consumer's purchasing process. The main purpose of studying consumer behavior is to understand how consumers feel and think. Building a recommendation engine is another application for studying consumer behavior. The recommendation engine basically recommends several products based on a variety of factors, including previous purchases by consumers, age, etc. It's a kind of data filtering tool that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a particular customer. The purpose of this paper is to analyze consumer segmentation and sentiment regarding product reviews and build a …"", ""Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or Chronic Kidney Failure is the increasing impairment of the kidney's ability to function normally. Chronic Kidney Disease is induced primarily due to high blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension, and several other factors in particular smoking, obesity, heart disease, heredity, consumption of alcohol, usage of drugs, age, race, ethnicity, etc. In India and other developing nations, chronic diseases remain a leading cause of mortality. The number of casualties in India owing to chronic disease was anticipated to be 5.21 million in 2008 and is likely to increase from over 7.63 million by 2020. There are five distinct stages of disease development in which each stage increases in severity while as it advances between stage 1 and stage 5. Stage 1 is when a person's kidney function falls below normal. As the affected individuals it goes ahead into step 2, they may experience a mild to moderate loss of renal functions. The worsening condition escalates in level 3, where there is a moderate to average deterioration in the nephrological operation followed by acute damage in the functioning of the excretory system in stage 4. Stage 5 is the absolute collapsing of the urinary organs.(Almustafa, 2021).The massive increase in the amount of medical data available to predict the disease has raised the question of being effectively classified, managed, and transferred. To extract useful insight and knowledge from this raw data, effective ways are required. Data mining techniques are a dependable and pragmatic way of accomplishing this. Data mining is the process for processing massive amounts of data and extracting"", ""Human beings express emotions in multiple ways. Some common ways that emotions are expressed are through writing, speech, facial expression, body language or gesture. In general, it is believed that emotions are, first and foremost, internal feelings and experience. Speech is a powerful form of communication that is accompanied by the speaker's emotions. Specific prosodic signs, such as pitch variation, frequency, speech speed, rhythm, and voice quality, are accessible to speakers to express and listeners to interpret and decode the full spoken message. This paper aims to establish an affective model based speech emotion recognition system using deep learning techniques such as RNNwith LSTMon German and English Language datasets."", 'Recognizing speech emotions is a formidable challenge due to the complexity of emotions. The function of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is significantly impacted by the effects of emotional signals retrieved from speech. The majority of emotional traits, on the other hand, are sensitive to emotionally neutral elements like the speaker, speaking manner, and gender. In this work, we postulate that computing deltas for individual features maintain useful information which is mainly relevant to emotional traits while it minimizes the loss of emotionally irrelevant components, thus leading to fewer misclassifications. Additionally, Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) commonly experiences silent and emotionally unrelated frames. The proposed technique is quite good at picking up important feature representations for emotion relevant features. So here is a two dimensional convolutional recurrent neural network that is attention-based to learn distinguishing characteristics and predict the emotions. The Mel-spectrogram is used for feature extraction.

Scalability is an important characteristic to the success of enterprises involved in doing business with cloud. Auto scaling has the ability to scale up or down the cloud resources based on demand. As Auto-scaling provides better fault tolerance, better availability and cost management, it improves an organization’s service level agreements. Most of the cloud service providers implement simplistic reactive autoscaling where resource availability is modified as a reaction to predefined threshold value set. However calculating the exact number of resources to scale up is a challenging task and hence to be addressed efficiently.
