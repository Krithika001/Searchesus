A densitometry study from dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) system is a popularly used method to assess BMD. BMD values vary depending on race, age, gender and other health conditions. As DEXA is quite an expensive method and requires frequent calibration process to work properly, in this paper, we explore the possibility of developing an affordable and reliable system depending on single X-ray absorptiometry with the use of supervised learning methods.

Caching performance can be improved by designing good replacement policies, prefetching techniques, clustering of web users and proper placement of proxy caches in the network. In this paper, we discuss the various approaches that were designed based on neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic to optimize the performance of web caching. The approaches discussed here proved to be more effective in solving the problems as compared to the conventional techniques that were used earlier in this problem domain. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms can be considered for further exploration in the various issues related to web caching and content delivery.', 'In wireless sensor networks (WSN), the clustering technique reduces energy efficiency and network lifetime. In this paper, a Fuzzy-based clustering architecture is proposed for cooperative communication in WSN in order to overcome this issue. In this work, a Cluster Head (CH) is chosen based on the parameters residual energy, trust, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and load. Then, the intra-cluster routing is performed using network coding-based probabilistic routing scheme. The fuzzy-based clustering protocol helps in determining the cooperative node (CN) which joins the cluster. Finally, particle swarm optimization is used to establish the optimum path between each CN and the CH for data transmission. The simulation results show that the proposed technique enhances the network lifetime and energy efficiency.', 'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) exert a pull on the modern research community towards many design challenges, especially, constraints on their lifetimes. Solutions proposed to save energy in WSNs posses their own merits and limitations. The trends evolved from the perspective of improving performance and scalability of conventional clustering approaches. They emerge by adopting cognitive techniques to handle uncertainty and instability present in the application atmosphere. This paper proposes a clustering approach for WSNs, namely, energy aware fuzzy clustering algorithm (EAFCA) which achieves lifetime enhancement in CH election, data aggregation and inter-cluster traffic phases of a multi-hop WSN environment. This algorithm contributes the process of cluster head (CH) election in a cluster in an energy-efficient manner by considering the residual energy, mean distance to 1-hop …', 'Link prediction has become an important task, especially with the rise of large-scale, complex and dynamic networks. The emerging research area of network dynamics and evolution is directly related to predicting new interactions between objects, a possibility in the near future. Recent studies show that the precision of link prediction can be improved to a great extent by including community information in the prediction methods. As traditional community-based link prediction algorithms can run only on stand-alone computers, they are not well suited for most of the large networks. Graph parallelization can be one solution to such problems. Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) programming model is a recently emerged framework for parallelizing graph algorithms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid similarity measure for link prediction in real world networks. We also propose a scalable method for community structure …', \"Internet is an important part in the daily life of people in many ways, which allows the people in any corner of the world to share all types of information. Image encryption is used to transmit sensitive multimedia information in unsecured networks to provide high degree of confidentiality. In this paper, a new image encryption method is proposed based on novel implementation of pixel scan, utilizing the Knight's Travel Path, and true random number. The Knight's travel path is a pattern in which the path of a Knight around a chess board is taken without revisiting any node. This travel path pattern is used to permute the pixel positions of the original image to obtain the scrambled image. The scrambled image is further XORed with the random key numbers to get the cipher image. To change the pixel values of the scrambled image, true random numbers are generated from the amplitude values of a chosen noise audio file …\", 'Sensor node localization is considered as one of the most significant issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and is classified as an unconstrained optimization problem that falls under NP-hard class of problems. Localization is stated as determination of physical co-ordinates of the sensor nodes that constitutes a WSN. In applications of sensor networks such as routing and target tracking, the data gathered by sensor nodes becomes meaningless without localization information. This work aims at determining the location of the sensor nodes with high precision. Initially this work is performed by localizing the sensor nodes using a range-free localization method namely, Mobile Anchor Positioning (MAP) which gives an approximate solution. To further minimize the location error, certain meta-heuristic approaches have been applied over the result given by MAP. Accordingly, Bat Optimization Algorithm with MAP …', 'Cryptography provides an effective solution to secure the communication over public networks. The communication over public networks that includes electronic commerce, business and military services, necessitates the requirement of simple and robust encryption techniques. In this paper, a novel image encryption method which employs calligraphy based hybrid scan and random number is presented. The original image is scrambled by pixel position permutation with calligraphy based diagonal and novel calligraphy based scan patterns. The cipher image is obtained by XORing the scrambled image with random numbers. The suggested method resists statistical, differential, entropy, and noise attacks which have been demonstrated with a set of standard images.', 'In today’s digital era, information is extensively stored and transmitted in the form of digital images, audio, and video files. Security is an important issue for storage and transmission of information due to the growth of electronic data exchange. Digital images are used in fields like telemedicine, military communication, and space research, so it is essential to protect the images from unauthorized disclosure during transmission. In this paper, a novel image encryption method is proposed using scan pattern, circular shift, and transposition methods. The pixels of the original image are permuted by the scan pattern generated by the notion of Kth smallest and stack dynamically. The circular shift and transposition are done by Shuffling Key (SK) generated from the original image. Value transformation is performed to confuse the relationship between the original and encrypted images using bitwise XOR operation. The proposed method satisfies the performance analysis tests such as histogram, correlation, large key space, and acceptable encryption speed. Also, the proposed method is resistant to statistical, brute force, and differential attacks.', 'Transmission and storage of multimedia data like audio, video, and images over the Internet has increased in today’s digital communication. Among the different multimedia data, images are transmitted and used very often. It is essential to protect the multimedia data from unauthorized disclosure during transmit. A novel approach for encrypting digital images using Matrix Reordering (MR), a kind of scanning, and simple XOR operation is proposed in this paper. The MR is applied to permute the pixel positions and the XOR operation is done to diffuse the pixel values. The bitwise XOR operation is performed using pseudorandom numbers generated by the linear congruential method.

The process of software development life cycle basically includes design, analysis, implementation, testing, and release phases. Generally, software testing is a critical task in the software development process wherein it is to save time and budget by detecting defects at the earliest and deliver a product without defects to the customers. This testing phase should be carefully operated in an effective manner to release a defect-free (bug-free) software product to the customers.

To improve the lifetime of a sensor network, it is essential to achieve load balancing among the sensor nodes. The grouping of sensor nodes into clusters is an efficient technique for conserving energy. Cluster Heads are elected for each of these clusters, in order to collect and aggregate the data from the sensor nodes within a cluster and forward it to the sink through a single-hop or multi-hop relay. In a multi-hop relay, cluster heads near to the sink are exposed to heavy traffic. The energy of these nodes is soon depleted and this is referred to the ‘hot-spot’ issue in sensor networks.

Localization is defined as finding the physical co-ordinates of a group of sensor nodes. Localization is classified as an unconstrained optimization problem. Localization protocols are broadly classified as range-based and range-free protocols. The range based protocols employ distance or angle estimation techniques, hardware. The range-free techniques depend on the contents of received messages to support coarse grained accuracy. In this paper, a range-free localization method known as Mobile Anchor Positioning-Mobile Anchor & Neighbor (MAP-M&N) is used to calculate the location of sensor nodes. Mobile Anchor equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS), broadcasts its coordinates to the sensor nodes as it moves through the network. As the sensor nodes collect enough beacons, they are able to calculate their locations. MAP-M&N with Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm (MAP-M&N with FSO) is the proposed metaheuristic approach to calculate the location of sensor nodes with minimal error. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the performance metric to compare between the two approaches namely, MAP-M&N and MAP-M&N with FSO. Simulation results reveal that MAP-M&N with FSO algorithm is effective to bring down the localization error to a bigger level when compared to using only MAP-M&N algorithm.', 'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are employed in various applications from healthcare to military.

The objective of localization is to determine the physical co-ordinates of sensor nodes distributed over the sensing field. Location information plays a vital role for coverage, deployment of sensor nodes, routing and target tracking applications. Initially, the localization of sensor nodes can be performed by Mobile Anchor Positioning (MAP), a range-free localization method.

The scope of this work is to compare the performance of these three algorithms. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been used as the metrics for comparing the performance. Simulation result demonstrates that out of the proposed algorithms, SA-DE-MAP algorithm achieves better performance in minimizing the localization error when compared to DE-MAP and ACO-MAP algorithms.', 'The important tasks in a wireless sensor network such as routing, target tracking are highly dependent on the location of a sensor node. Hence localization becomes an essential criterion in wireless sensor networks. Higher the localization accuracy better is the performance of the sensor network as a whole. Traditional mathematical algorithms can be used for localization. But these algorithms do not give very high localization accuracy. Genetic algorithm is proven to be effective in searching a solution space and hence can be modeled for the localization problem in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN).

The KBGA was also tested on a variety of images in three different bits values per pixel to show its strength. The proposed KBGA produces an average PSNR gain of 3.3% and average MSE gain of 20.6% over the default JPEG quantization table. The performance measures such as average unfitness value, likelihood of evolution leap, and likelihood of optimality are used to validate the efficacy of the proposed KBGA. The novelty of the KBGA lies in the number of generations used to attain an optimal solution as compared to the CGA.

The shape and texture of the mass are key parameters used in the diagnosis of breast cancer. To recover the shape of the mass, semantic segmentation is found to be more useful rather than mere object detection (or) localization. The main challenges involved in the mass segmentation include:(a) low signal to noise ratio (b) indiscernible mass boundaries, and (c) more false positives.

The utilization of point-to-multipoint transmission has traditionally been limited to local area network applications. Over the past few years the internet has seen a rise in the number of new applications that rely on multicast transmission. Multicast IP conservers bandwidth by forcing the network to do packet replication only when necessary, and offers an attractive to unicast transmission for the delivery of network ticker tapes, live stock quotes, multiparty video conferencing and shared whiteboard applications (among others). It is important to note that the application for IP multicast are not only solely limited to the Internet. Multicast IP can also pay an important role in large distributed commercial networks. Recently, network coding has been applied to the reliable multicast in networks and also in content distribution network, where intermediate nodes between the source and the receivers of an end-to-end communication session are not only capable of relaying and replicating data messages, but also of coding incoming messages to produce coded outgoing ones. The basic idea behind network coding is the summation of incoming information traffic through simple XOR. It can be used to improve throughput, reduce the number of transmission, better network management, less BER, minimum delay, less resource consumption.

Current location management schemes lack scalability and, hence, are proven unable to work in large scale networks. Therefore, location management in VANETs remains a major challenge. In this project a new concept of region-based location-service-management protocol (RLSMP) that uses mobility patterns as means to synthesize node movement is deployed in large VANET applications. The protocol attempts to relax the scalability issue suffered by other protocols (SLURP, XYLS, HLS) by employing message aggregation in location updating and in querying.

Machine learning techniques such as Decision trees have been applied to the field of intrusion detection. Machine learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that are used to detect attacks on computer system. In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach. A comparative study of the three approaches is done …'"

Further, the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure is demonstrated in a numerical example with the help of measure of performance and measure of error. Moreover, medical diagnosis problems have been exhibited through a hypothetical case study by using this proposed similarity measure. Finally, the proposed method is applied to 10 different medical data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets and its similarity measures are calculated.

Isotonic separation is a supervised machine learning technique in which classification is represented as a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) with an objective of minimizing the number of misclassifications. It is computationally expensive to solve the LPP using traditional methods for a large dataset. Characteristics of the training set such as size, presence of noisy data, influence the learning algorithm and classification performance. To resolve this issue, this paper introduces a new linearithmic time algorithm called Soft set based instance selection algorithm (SOFIA) which provides a condensed dataset for a learning algorithm. And, a hybrid classification algorithm, SOFIAIS which utilizes SOFIA for instance selection and isotonic separation (IS) for classification is introduced. Two sets of experimental studies are conducted on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the results are reported. First, experiments are performed on SOFIA-IS and the results are compared with isotonic separation and its variants. Then experiments are done on state of the art machine learning techniques by including SOFIA for instance selection and the results are compared with same techniques without SOFIA. Experimental and statistical results show that the condensed sets obtained by SOFIA are optimum, and SOFIA-IS and SOFIA based machine learning techniques are better in terms of classification accuracy, time and space complexity.', 'total_citations': {'cited_by': {'total': 6, 'link': 'https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=9748258338063292705&as_sdt=5', 'serpapi_link': 'https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=9748258338063292705&engine=google_scholar&hl=en', 'cites_id': '9748258338063292705'}, 'table': [{'year': 2015, 'citations': 2}, {'year': 2016, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2017, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2018, 'citations': 1}, {'year': 2019, 'citations': 1}]}}, {'title': 'Morphological markers for identification of hybrids and their parental lines in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).', 'link': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20183015765', 'authors': 'CKK Reddy, SK Jain, KMB Arun, SG Krishnan, Awani Kumar Singh, Hussain Zakir', 'publication_date': '2017', 'journal': 'Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences', 'publisher': 'Indian Council of Agricultural Research', 'description': 'Four hybrids, viz, PH-1, 2, 4 and 8 and their parental lines were studied for developing identification keys using morphological characters.

Endoscopic sinus surgery, therefore, is a potentially useful method for treating large frontal mucoceles.', 'In this paper the notion of α-γ-open sets in a topological space together with its corresponding interior and closure operators are introduced. Further some of their basic properties are studied.', 'This paper presents a novel hybrid technique which is developed by incorporating the fractional derivatives in the generalised integral transform method. Homotopy analysis method is combined with fractional generalised integral transform method to solve the fractional order nonlinear differential equations. The performance of the proposed method is analysed by solving various categories of nonlinear fractional differential equations like Navier Stokes’s model and Riccatti equations, etc. Unlike the other analytical methods, the hybrid method provides a better way to control the convergence region of the obtained series solution through an auxiliary parameter h. Furthermore, as proposed in this paper, the ‘Fractional Generalised Homotopy Analysis Method’ along with the several examples reveal that this method can be effectively used as a tool for solving various kinds of nonlinear fractional differential equations.', 'In this paper, we introduce the concept of soft g* closed sets and soft g* open sets in soft topological space which are defined over an initial universe set with a fixed set of parameters together with its corresponding soft g* closure and soft g* interior operators. Also, we introduce the concept of soft and regular spaces and investigate the relationship between them.', 'Low profile antenna in communication is a new methodology. Fractal geometry is a methodology through which size reduction is achieved. A Self-similar fractal antenna using multicantor technique is proposed and experimentally studied. Space-filling cantors and self-similarity properties of fractal geometry have been adopted in the proposed antenna to miniaturize the size of antenna. The antenna is designed in such a way to operate at MICS band (Medical Implant communication Service) for wireless telemedicine application. The prototype antenna exhibits wideband characteristics and provides a good agreement of return loss (S11). Experimental return loss has been compared with that which is obtained using method of moments. The objective of using self-similar concept in antenna makes it flexible in terms of controlling the resonance and bandwidth. In this paper, the Self-similar property of fractal geometry is examined by maintaining return loss (S11) more than –30 dB approximately in all the iterations (n) and the prototype antenna has return loss greater than –10 dB and exhibits wideband characteristics.', 'This paper proposes the notion of a fractional generalised integral transform (Fractional G-transform) using modified Riemann-Liouville derivative with the Mittag-Leffler function as a kernel. We investigate the basic properties of the Fractional G-transform. In addition, the homotopy analysis is incorporated to introduce a hybrid Fractional Generalised Homotopy Analysis Method using Modified Riemann-Liouville Derivative, which is denoted as MRFGHAM. We highlight the merits of MRFGHAM and apply it to solve fractional nonlinear differential equations. The proposed method is implemented to formulate a fractional non-fatal disease epidemic model and to obtain the results of a spreading process subject to various settings of the fractional parameters. We also statistically validate the variations in the spread of the non-fatal disease obtained at different stages. Furthermore, the fractional power epidemic model is …', 'In this paper the concept of α-γ-compact spaces and α-γ0-compact spaces are introduced. Some of their properties are also studied.

These attempts have met with mixed success. The focus of this review is the use of molecular markers as predictive tools in the context of practical hybrid plant breeding, not the use of molecular markers to understand the basis of heterosis.The term “heterosis” was coined by Shull in 1914, and refers to the manifestation of superiority of F1 performance relative to parental performance. The increase in vigor due to crossing,“heterosis,” and the decrease in vigor due to inbreeding,“inbreeding depression,” are linked in that each phenomenon defines the other. Heterosis has been utilized on a large scale for the production of crops such as maize, sorghum, pearl millet, rice, oilseeds, cotton, vegetables, and fruits, significantly boosting the production of these …', '', 'A set of 390 iso-cytoplasmic restorer lines were developed from 25 popular rice hybrids grown in India through pedigree breeding exercising selection for spikelet fertility, yield and extent of panicle exsertion were evaluated for various agromorphological traits. Correlation analysis showed that yield per plant was significantly correlated with number of tillers (0.208), panicle length (0.127) and spikelet fertility (0.134). Principal component analysis indicated that the first four principal components had eigenvalue of> 1.0 and cumulatively explained 74.3% of total variance. Grain characters namely, test weight (0.451), kernel length before cooking (0.418), kernel breadth before cooking (0.136) and spikelet fertility (0.402) contributed positively towards principal component I. Yield per plant showed a positively skewed distribution with panicle length and a nearly linear relationship with spikelet fertility. A core set of 21 genotypes capturing the entire range of phenotype for different traits, was identified from 390 genotypes using advanced M (maximization) strategy and statistically validated. Besides this, promising iso-cytoplasmic restorer lines originating from different hybrids were identified for various agromorphological traits. This is the first report on developing iso-cytoplasmic restorers from popular rice hybrids, which can be used in developing heterotic hybrids when crossed with diverse non-parental CMS lines.', 'The objective of this paper is to introduce the notion of fractional derivatives in the energy equations and to study the chaotic nature of the temperature distribution in a heat exchanger with variation of temperature dependent transport properties. The governing fractional partial differential equations are transformed to a set of recurrence relations using fractional differential transform method and solved using inverse transform. The approximate analytical solution obtained by the proposed method has good agreement with the existing results.', 'In supervised machine learning, a training set containing labeled instances is taken by a learning algorithm to construct a model that is subsequently used for determining the class label of new instances. Isotonic separation is a supervised machine learning technique in which classification is represented as a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) with an objective of minimizing the number of misclassifications. It is computationally expensive to solve the LPP using traditional methods for a large dataset. Characteristics of the training set such as size, presence of noisy data, influence the learning algorithm and classification performance. To resolve this issue, this paper introduces a new linearithmic time algorithm called Soft set based instance selection algorithm (SOFIA) which provides a condensed dataset for a learning algorithm. And, a hybrid classification algorithm, SOFIAIS which utilizes SOFIA for instance selection and isotonic separation (IS) for classification is introduced. Two sets of experimental studies are conducted on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the results are reported. First, experiments are performed on SOFIA-IS and the results are compared with isotonic separation and its variants. Then experiments are done on state of the art machine learning techniques by including SOFIA for instance selection and the results are compared with same techniques without SOFIA. Experimental and statistical results show that the condensed sets obtained by SOFIA are optimum, and SOFIA-IS and SOFIA based machine learning techniques are better in terms of classification accuracy, time and space complexity.', 'Four hybrids, viz, PH-1, 2, 4 and 8 and their parental lines were studied for developing identification keys using morphological characters. Out of 39 characters studied, fourteen qualitative and six quantitative characters were polymorphic for identifying the parents from the hybrids and also among themselves. Characters like stem anthocyanin pigmentation on upper one-third portion, fruit green shoulder, leaflet petiole attitude with respect to main axis, leaf serration, stem pubescence, fruit shape at blossom end, fruit shape in longitudinal section and stigma lobes were important for development of identification keys. These characters were stable during two growing seasons (rabi 2014-15 and rabi 2015-16) and no variation was observed for any character in any genotype. A combination of these morphological markers could effectively utilized for distinguishing all the hybrids and their parental lines under study.', \"Kovalevsky [8] introduced the tracing algorithm in abstract cellular complexes.
